                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>A tournament is a competition between <em>X-Wing</em> players. After enrolling in the tournament, they
                        are paired against one another in an organized fashion to play a game. After multiple games
                        against different opponents, players are ranked according to their performance. Most
                        tournaments conclude with the awarding of prizes to top finishers.</p>
                        <p>Tournaments are played using the rules provided in the <em>X-Wing</em> Rules Reference and FAQ, both
                            of which may be downloaded from the <em>X-Wing</em> page of our website at any time. Additional rules
                            for playing games in a tournament are detailed in this document.</p>
                            <p>This document explains important tournament concepts and provides the details for Standard

                                    Regulations to learn any important differences.</p>

                                    <h2>Tournament Participant Roles</h2>
                                    <p>Every person present at a tournament is a participant. Participants fulfill specific roles based on
                                        their responsibilities to the tournament. All participants share the responsibility of acting in a
                                        respectful manner toward one another. Please read the Fundamental Event Document for a
                                        detailed explanation of these roles. Participant leader roles are: organizer, judge, and marshal.
                                        Other roles include player and spectator.</p>
                                        <h3>Organizer</h3>
                                        <p>An event must have exactly one organizer. The organizer is responsible for the oversight of the
                                            entire event, including both planning and execution. If the organizer does not assign a marshal
                                            for the event, the organizer must perform the responsibilities of the marshal role.</p>
                                            <h3>Marshal</h3>
                                            <p>An event may have any number of marshals, including none. A marshal is an expert <span class="updates">on the
                                                game's rules and regulations and the final authority on their application during a
                                                tournament. A marshal also determines if unsporting conduct has occurred and what the
                                                appropriate remedy is, referring any recommendations for disqualification to the
                                                organizer. When a marshal is not actively performing his or her duties, he or she is a
                                                spectator and should communicate this change in status clearly.</span></p>
                                                <h3>Judge</h3>
                                                <p>An event may have any number of judges, including none. A judge is well versed in the game's
                                                    rules and regulations. A judge's responsibilities include assisting players to resolve disputes and
                                                    <span class="updates">answering</span> questions regarding the game's rules. <span class="updates">When a judge is not actively performing
                                                        judge duties, he or she is a spectator and should communicate this change in status clearly.</span></p>
                                                        <h3>Player</h3>
                                                        <p>A player is an individual that plays <em>X-Wing</em> at the event. A player must bring all components they
                                                            need to play a game of <em>X-Wing</em>. <span class="updates">When a player is not actively engaged in a game of X-Wing,
                                                                he or she is a spectator.</span></p>
                                                                <h3>Spectator</h3>
                                                                <p>A spectator is any individual at a tournament not actively engaging in another role. Spectators
                                                                    must not disturb an ongoing game, and cannot provide any input or assistance to players during
                                                                    their games.</p>
                                                                    <h3>Leader Participation</h3>
                                                                    <p>A leader may participate <span class="updates">as a player</span> in a Relaxed tier tournament for which he or she is responsible
                                                                        only if there is a second leader present. The second leader must be announced at the beginning of
                                                                        the tournament and is responsible for all rulings for games in which the first leader is playing. If
                                                                        two leaders play one another, the marshal is responsible for any rulings during the game.</p>
                                                                        <p>During Formal and Premier tier tournaments, leaders cannot participate <span class="updates">as a player</span>. Leaders for
                                                                            Formal and Premier tournaments are expected to commit their full attention to overseeing the event.</p>
                                                                            <h3>Conduct</h3>
