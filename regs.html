                    Tournaments supported by the Organized Play ("OP") program for the <em>Star Wars&trade;: X-Wing&trade;
                    Miniatures Game</em>, sponsored by Fantasy Flight Games ("FFG") and its international partners,
                    follow the rules provided in this document.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    A tournament is a competition between <em>X-Wing</em> players. After enrolling in the tournament, they
                    are paired against one another in an organized fashion to play a game. After multiple games
                    against different opponents, players are ranked according to their performance. Most
                    tournaments conclude with the awarding of prizes to top finishers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tournaments are played using the rules provided in the <em>X-Wing</em> Rules Reference and FAQ, both
                    of which may be downloaded from the <em>X-Wing</em> page of our website at any time. Additional rules
                    for playing games in a tournament are detailed in this document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document explains important tournament concepts and provides the details for Standard
                    Play tournaments<span class="updates">, which use squad building rules that mandate a 100-point maximum for
                    squads</span>. When running an event with a different format, please also read the Alternate Format
                    Regulations to learn any important differences.

                <h2>Tournament Participant Roles</h2>
                <p>
                    Every person present at a tournament is a participant. Participants fulfill specific roles based on
                    their responsibilities to the tournament. All participants share the responsibility of acting in a
                    respectful manner toward one another. Please read the Fundamental Event Document for a
                    detailed explanation of these roles. Participant leader roles are: organizer, judge, and marshal.
                    Other roles include player and spectator.
                </p>
                <h3>Organizer</h3>
                <p>
                    An event must have exactly one organizer. The organizer is responsible for the oversight of the
                    entire event, including both planning and execution. If the organizer does not assign a marshal
                    for the event, the organizer must perform the responsibilities of the marshal role.
                </p>
                <h3>Marshal</h3>
                <p>
                    An event may have any number of marshals, including none. A marshal is an expert <span class="updates">on the
                    game's rules and regulations and the final authority on their application during a
                    tournament. A marshal also determines if unsporting conduct has occurred and what the
                    appropriate remedy is, referring any recommendations for disqualification to the
                    organizer. When a marshal is not actively performing his or her duties, he or she is a
                    spectator and should communicate this change in status clearly.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Judge</h3>
                <p>
                    An event may have any number of judges, including none. A judge is well versed in the game's
                    rules and regulations. A judge's responsibilities include assisting players to resolve disputes and
                    <span class="updates">answering</span> questions regarding the game's rules. <span class="updates">When a judge is not actively performing
                    judge duties, he or she is a spectator and should communicate this change in status clearly.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Player</h3>
                <p>
                    A player is an individual that plays <em>X-Wing</em> at the event. A player must bring all components they
                    need to play a game of <em>X-Wing</em>. <span class="updates">When a player is not actively engaged in a game of X-Wing,
                    he or she is a spectator.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Spectator</h3>
                <p>
                    A spectator is any individual at a tournament not actively engaging in another role. Spectators
                    must not disturb an ongoing game, and cannot provide any input or assistance to players during
                    their games.
                </p>
                <h3>Leader Participation</h3>
                <p>
                    A leader may participate <span class="updates">as a player</span> in a Relaxed tier tournament for which he or she is responsible
                    only if there is a second leader present. The second leader must be announced at the beginning of
                    the tournament and is responsible for all rulings for games in which the first leader is playing. If
                    two leaders play one another, the marshal is responsible for any rulings during the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Formal and Premier tier tournaments, leaders cannot participate <span class="updates">as a player</span>. Leaders for
                    Formal and Premier tournaments are expected to commit their full attention to overseeing the event.
                </p>
                <h3>Conduct</h3>
                <p>
                    All tournament participants are expected to act in a respectful manner during a tournament. If
                    players have a dispute during a competition and cannot resolve it themselves, they must call for a
                    judge to resolve it and provide any rulings that are needed. All card interpretations during a
                    tournament are a marshal's responsibility, and he or she may overrule the rules documents when
                    a mistake or error is discovered.
                </p>
                <h4>Unsporting Conduct</h4>
                <p>
                    Players are expected to behave in a mature and considerate manner, and to play within the rules
                    and not abuse them. This prohibits intentionally stalling a game for time, placing components
                    with excessive force, inappropriate behavior, treating an opponent with a lack of courtesy or
                    respect, cheating, etc. Collusion among players to manipulate scoring is expressly forbidden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The organizer, at his or her sole discretion, may remove players from the tournament for
                    unsporting conduct.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Tournament Materials</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many materials and game components needed to facilitate a tournament. The organizer
                    and players are both responsible for supplying certain items.
                </p>
                <h3>Organizer Materials</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to arranging a location, the organizer is responsible for securing tables that can hold a
                    3' by 3' play surface for each <span class="updates">game of two players</span>, as well as chairs. While the organizer can
                    mark the required play area on a table with tape or another simple method, providing playmats or
                    a similar material in 3' by 3' dimensions to create friction and prevent ships from sliding out of
                    place is strongly recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The organizer should have table numbers on hand or some other method of demarcation so
                    players can easily find their seats at the beginning of each tournament round. The organizer is
                    responsible for having blank squad lists and pens available if they are required for the event.
                    Finally, the organizer is also responsible for having all required rules documents on hand for
                    reference during the event. This includes the <em>X-Wing</em> Core Set Rules Reference, <em>X-Wing</em> FAQ, <em>X-Wing</em>
                    Tournament Regulations (this document), any Event Outline relevant to the event, and any
                    other relevant document for the event. Most of these documents can be found on the <em>X-Wing</em>
                    page of our website.
                </p>
                <h4>Playmats</h4>
                <p>
                    In events where players provide their own playmats, only official FFG <em>X-Wing&trade; Playmats</em> are
                    allowed. This is to guarantee a consistent experience for all players and prevent any advantage
                    players may gain from familiarity with a particular playmat that is not widely available. FFG
                    playmats are widely available for examination and play. If a venue provides playmats for their
                    event, they may use third-party playmats. Players may replace third-party playmats if they provide
                    their own FFG playmat to use.
                </p>
                <h3>Player Materials</h3>
                <p>
                    Players are responsible for bringing all of the game components required to play a game of <em>X-Wing</em>.
                    This includes all ship models, bases, pegs, Pilot cards, ship tokens, Upgrade cards, and
                    tokens. In addition, they must bring a damage deck, sufficient dice for attack and defense rolls, a
                    full set of maneuver templates, and a range ruler. When a squad list is required, players should
                    bring a completed list or arrive at the venue early to fill one out.
                </p>
                <h4>Squad Building</h4>
                <p>
                    Each player must build one squad <span class="updates">to use for the duration of the</span> tournament. A squad cannot
                    exceed 100 points, though it may contain fewer than 100 points. A player may choose to field a
                    Rebel, an Imperial, or a Scum &amp; Villainy squad. Players may choose to use either the original
                    Core Set damage deck or <em>The Force Awakens&trade;</em> Core Set damage deck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each player must include exactly three unique obstacle tokens of their choice in their squad.
                    Players must select these obstacles from the twelve asteroids included in the two core sets and
                    the six debris clouds included in the <em>YT-2400</em> and <em>VT-49 Decimator</em> expansion packs. A player
                    may not select two of the same asteroid or debris cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players must use the same squad, damage deck, and obstacles for the duration of the tournament.
                </p>
                <h4><span class="updates">Squad Lists</span></h4>
                <p>
                    Some events require players to submit a squad list, including <span class="updates">their name and</span> all associated
                    Upgrade cards, total squad points, damage deck, and obstacles to the organizer before the start of
                    the tournament.
                </p>
                <span class="updates">
                    <p>
                        If a player uses a ship or upgrade card with the same name and squad points as a different
                        component available, he or she must uniquely identify that card. The recommended way to
                        uniquely identify a card is by including the full name of the core set or expansion product
                        in which the card appeared in parenthesis. A player can ask a leader for specific
                        instructions if they are unsure of the best method to uniquely identify a card.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unique identification example: Veronica includes a YT-1300 in her squad, using the original
                        Han Solo ship card and the newest Millennium Falcon title upgrade card, both of which have
                        the same name and squad points as a different component. Veronica writes "Han Solo
                        (Millennium Falcon) 46 points" and "Millennium Falcon (Heroes of the Resistance) 1 point"
                        on her squad list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a leader discovers a player's squad list missing appropriate information, he or she should
                        find that player immediately and update the squad list based on the cards the player is
                        using. If this would result in a significant and potentially advantageous change, the leader
                        should consider investigating for possible cheating.
                    </p>
                </span>
                <h4>Multiple Faction Ships</h4>
                <p>
                    All pilot cards and ship tokens in a player's squad must belong to the same faction. If a player's
                    ship has different versions in more than one faction, he or she may use any version of that ship's
                    model and dial in his or her squad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Multiple Ship Example</strong>: <em>Scott is fielding a Scum &amp; Villainy squad consisting of four Z-95
                    Headhunters and one Firespray. His Firespray model and dial are from the Imperial Firespray
                    expansion, two of his Z-95 Headhunter models and dials are from the Rebel Z-95 expansion, and
                    the final two of his Z-95 Headhunter models and dials are from the Scum &amp; Villainy Most Wanted
                    expansion. However, all of his pilot cards and ship tokens are from the Scum &amp; Villainy faction.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Sharing Components</h4>
                <p>
                    Before or during a tournament round, any player may request that a single range ruler, set of
                    maneuver templates, and/or set of dice be shared for the duration of the round. Any decisions are
                    subject to review by a marshal or a judge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The marshal may mandate that players must share a single range ruler, set of maneuver
                    templates, and/or set of dice during a round.
                </p>
                <h4>Component Modifications</h4>
                <p>
                    During tournament play, each player is required to use the components included in official <em>X-Wing</em>
                    products (see "Legal Products" on page 9). Questions about a component's eligibility
                    should be directed to a marshal. If a necessary component is ruled ineligible and the player
                    cannot locate a replacement for it, that player is dropped from the tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players must identify copies of the same ship in his or her squad, and its corresponding Ship
                    card, with a token, a sticker, or any other form of marking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players are welcome and encouraged to personalize their squads according to the following rules:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Players may paint their ship models. They cannot modify a ship model in any way that
                        would create confusion about which ship the model represents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players cannot modify ship bases to alter their size or shape. Weight may be added to a ship
                        base if it does not alter the shape of the base. Ship pegs (including the connecting pegs
                        affixed to ship models) may be modified or replaced with a different connecting method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cards must remain unaltered, though they may be sleeved for protection. Sleeves for
                        Damage cards must be identical and unaltered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players may mark their tokens and their maneuver dials to indicate ownership as long as
                        the function of the component is not compromised. However, players should be careful not
                        to mark the backs of their maneuver dials in any way that may indicate to their opponents
                        what maneuvers they have selected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players may mark their asteroids, debris fields, and bomb tokens to indicate ownership, but
                        cannot otherwise alter them in any way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players may mark dice with a permanent or indelible marker to indicate ownership in an
                        unobtrusive manner, but cannot otherwise alter them in any way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If two or more models in play could potentially touch causing conflict with movement or
                        placement of ships (e.g. two <em>Millennium Falcon</em> ships are placed with their bases
                        touching), players must adjust the number of plastic pegs to increase or decrease height
                        until the ship models are not touching.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Lost and Damaged Components</h4>
                <p>
                    If a player loses a component during a tournament, he or she has an opportunity to find a
                    replacement, if necessary. Any player that discovers they are missing an essential component at
                    the beginning of or during a round should notify a leader. The leader will give the player a short
                    time extension to their game in order to find a replacement. If the player cannot find a
                    replacement within that time, they must concede the game. If the player is unable to find a
                    replacement by the start of the next round, they should be removed from the tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an essential component becomes damaged during the course of a tournament, he or she has an
                    opportunity to find a replacement. If the player cannot find a replacement, the damaged
                    component is treated as lost unless it falls within one of the following categories.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Damaged Card</strong>: The player keeps the original card near the rest of his or her squad and
                        uses a proxy card in its place for the remainder of the tournament. A leader will create the
                        proxy, including the card name, any information that is no longer legible or available on the
                        damaged card, the name of the leader who created it, and the date it was created.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Damaged Ship Model or Connection</strong>: The model, in its damaged state, does not impede
                        the progress of play and abides by the rules under "Component Modifications" on page 7.
                        If the model does impede play, the player keeps the model near the rest of his or her squad
                        for the remainder of the tournament.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Damaged Dice, Range Ruler, or Maneuver Template</strong>: The player keeps the original
                        component near the rest of his or her squad and requests to share his or her opponent's
                        component for each remaining round of the tournament.
                    </li>

                    <h4>Tokens</h4>
                    <p>
                        Tokens are representations of information about the game or game state. The presence of
                        tokens-other than tokens that are essential components-is marked by one or more
                        indicators. Indicators may also be used to represent multiple tokens, or other open or derived
                        information. Essential tokens are ship and obstacle tokens, as well as any bomb tokens (in a
                        reasonable quantity) required for a player's list. Other tokens are not essential components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typically, players use the cardboard tokens included in official product as indicators. However,
                        players may choose to use other items as indicators, so long as they do not obscure significant
                        component information, are resistant to accidental modification, and their purpose of use is
                        clear to both players. The marshal is responsible for determining the legality of an indicator and
                        its reasonable usage during a match if objected to by its owner's opponent.

                <h2>Tournament Play</h2>
                <p>
                    This section provides information and considerations for playing a game of <em>X-Wing</em> at a tournament.
                </p>
                <h3>Tournament Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    Before the tournament begins, the organizer must set up tables suitable for tournament play. Each
                    table must contain a 3' by 3' square play area with clearly delineated edges. Players should have
                    enough space on the table to comfortably place all of the components necessary for their squads.
                    <span class="updates">In addition, the organizer should clearly communicate the details of the event to players
                    ahead of time.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Game Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    The following steps must be performed before players can begin their game each tournament round.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Each player places their squad outside of the 3' by 3' play area next to their assigned
                        player edge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both players reveal all components in their squads and assign ID tokens to any ships that
                        have a duplicate on the same team. If both players fielded squads from the same faction,
                        players assign ID tokens to all ships or agree on another method of differentiating squads.
                        One player must display only the white numerals of his ID tokens; the other player must
                        display only the black numerals. <span class="updates">Prior to the first round of a tournament, the marshal
                        may mandate that each player manually verify their opponent's squad point total.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each player may request to examine their opponent's Damage deck to validate its
                        contents. Each player shuffles their Damage deck thoroughly and presents it to their
                        opponent. The opponent may shuffle and cut the deck if desired.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players determine initiative. The player with the lowest squad point total decides which
                        player has initiative. If both players are tied with the same squad point total, players must
                        use a method to determine a player at random, such as tossing a coin. The winner decides
                        who has initiative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each player places their three unique asteroids and/or debris cloud tokens next to the play
                        area to form a pool of six obstacles. The player with initiative chooses one of these
                        obstacles and places it into the play area. Then, the other player chooses one of the
                        remaining obstacles and places it into the play area. The players continue to alternate
                        until all six obstacles have been placed. An obstacle cannot be placed at Range 1-2 of
                        any edge of the play area or at Range 1 of another obstacle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players place their ships in ascending order of pilot skill as per standard X-Wing rules.
                        Players cannot measure distance and spacing with physical objects during setup except
                        when using range rulers and maneuver templates within Range 1 of that player's edge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players activate shields and prepare any special components they may need. Players may
                        not begin moving ships until the organizer officially announces the start of the
                        tournament round.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Once players complete the steps above, they should wait for a leader to announce the start of the
                    round before beginning their game. If the round has already begun, players may begin playing
                    immediately upon completing these steps.
                </p>
                <h3>Damage Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    When a player's ship is dealt a Damage card, the card is taken from that player's own Damage
                    deck. Players must maintain their own discard piles for their Damage cards. Before shuffling,
                    players may request to examine their opponent's Damage deck to validate its contents. A marshal
                    or judge may check Damage decks at any time.
                </p>
                <h3>Destroyed Ships</h3>
                <p>
                    To facilitate calculating a player's score when a game ends (see "Calculating a Player's Score"
                    on page 15), each player should maintain a score pile next to their Ship cards. When a ship is
                    destroyed, the owner of the ship places the corresponding Ship card into their score pile along
                    with all Upgrade cards equipped to that ship (including any cards discarded during that game,
                    such as missiles, bombs, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each player's destroyed ships and discarded Upgrade cards are open information.
                </p>
                <h4>Discarded Cards</h4>
                <p>
                    When a player is instructed to discard an Upgrade card, he or she flips it facedown instead. If a
                    player is instructed to discard a Dual card, he or she places it under the Ship card it is attached to
                    instead. Dual cards under a Ship card are considered facedown. Facedown Upgrade cards and
                    Dual cards under Ship cards are out of play but remain equipped to their respective ships. They
                    are not placed into a player's score pile unless the ship to which they are equipped is destroyed.
                </p>
                <h3>Margin of Error</h3>
                <p>
                    Ships are sometimes moved accidentally or placed inexactly during the normal course of the
                    game. A small margin of error is allowed in the position and orientation of ships in these
                    situations so that the pace of the game is not unnecessarily affected. Players should not abuse this
                    margin of error, and they must use the tools included with the game to be as accurate as possible.
                    Using excessive force when placing components to intentionally move other components is
                    expressly forbidden. In the event of a dispute, players should call a judge for assistance.
                </p>
                <h3>Missed Opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                    Players are expected to follow the game's rules, remembering to perform actions and use card
                    effects when indicated. <span class="updates">It is all players' responsibility to maintain a proper game state, and
                    to ensure that all mandatory abilities and game steps are acknowledged.</span> If a player forgets
                    to use an effect during the timing specified by that effect, he or she cannot retroactively use it
                    without the consent of his or her opponent. Players are expected to act with respect and not
                    intentionally distract or rush an opponent with the intent of forcing a missed opportunity.
                </p>
                <h3>Taking Nodes and Outside Material</h3>
                <p>
                    Players cannot take notes or reference outside material or information during a tournament round.
                    However, players may reference official rule documents or game components that do not contain

                <h2>Tournament Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    The tournament concepts together create the framework for any <em>X-Wing</em> tournament.
                </p>
                <h3>Tournament Round Times</h3>
                <p>
                    Each tournament round of <em>X-Wing</em> is a predetermined length, giving players a certain amount of
                    time to complete their games. A leader should start the timer for a tournament round after most
                    players have found their seats and begun to set up. If a game has not concluded when the time for
                    a tournament round runs out, the players finish the current game round and then calculate their
                    scores (see "End of Round" on page 14). A tournament round's length varies depending on the
                    type of round.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Swiss Rounds</strong>: 75 minutes each
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Single Elimination Rounds (except Final)</strong>: 75 minutes each
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Single Elimination Round</strong>: 120 minutes
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Pairings</h3>
                <p>
                    Each <span class="updates">tournament</span> round, players are paired with an opponent, against whom they play a game of
                    <em>X-Wing</em>. The method of pairing may change based on what type of rounds are being used. The
                    organizer must announce the number <span class="updates">and type(s)</span> of rounds and what size <span class="updates">any progression cuts</span>
                    will be before the start of the tournament.
                </p>
                <span class="updates">
                    <p>
                        When necessary, a player may be assigned a bye instead of being paired against an
                        opponent. That player receives a win with a Margin of Victory of 150 for that round of the
                        tournament. The rules for when to assign a bye to a player are detailed in the relevant
                        sections below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Players should not be paired against the same opponent more than once during a single
                        stage of a tournament. In general, a single stage of a tournament ends when a progression
                        cut is made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a player no longer wishes to continue playing, he or she can notify the organizer of their
                        intent. The organizer will avoid pairing him or her in future rounds by dropping them from
                        the tournament. Players are also dropped if they do not appear for a round in which they
                        are paired within a reasonable time limit, or if they are no longer able to play for another
                        reason. Players can request that the organizer allow them to rejoin an event from which
                        they were dropped, being assigned an unpaired loss for each round they did not attend.
                        Disqualified players are removed from the tournament, and cannot rejoin.
                    </p>
                </span>
                <h4>Swiss Rounds</h4>
                <span class="updates">
                    <p>
                        Most <em>X-Wing</em> tournaments use a Swiss pairing system that awards tournament points to the
                        winner of each game. Each Swiss round pairs players in head-to-head games, attempting to
                        match players with the same number of tournament points together while preventing
                        players from playing the same opponent more than once. At the end of Swiss rounds, the
                        winner of the tournament is the player with most tournament points unless there are single
                        elimination rounds (see "Single Elimination Rounds" on page 14).
                    </p>
                </span>
                <p>
                    For the first round of Swiss pairings, players are matched randomly against an opponent. For
                    each round after the first, players are paired at random against another player with the same
                    number of tournament points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine pairings, take the group of players with the most tournament points and pair them
                    at random. If there is an odd number of players in that group, pair the remaining player with a
                    random player from the group of players with the next most tournament points. Then, pair all
                    remaining players in the second group at random. Continue this until all players are paired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is an odd number of players in the tournament, a player at random receives the bye in the
                    first round. In later rounds, <span class="updates">if there is an odd number of players remaining in the
                    tournament,</span> the bye is given to the lowest ranked player who has not yet received a bye. <span class="updates">When
                    a player receives a bye, he or she receives a win and a Margin of Victory of 150 (see
                    "Margin of Victory" on page XX).</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pairing example</strong>: <em>John, Stella, and Laramy all have 5 tournament points, the most out of any
                    player in the tournament. Kyle is the next highest-ranked player and the only player with 4
                    tournament points. John is paired against Stella. Because there are no other players with 5
                    tournament points, Laramy is paired against Kyle.</em>
                </p>
                <span class="updates">
                    <h4>Progression Cut</h4>
                    <p>
                        Many <em>X-Wing</em> tournaments set a predetermined number of rounds, at the end of which all
                        players that meet a certain performance criteria advance to the next stage of the
                        tournament and all other players are dropped. This is commonly referred to as "making a
                        cut," and is often accompanied by a change in the type of tournament rounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These tournament regulations cover the type of cut used for the Basic and Advanced
                        tournament structures: a standings-based cut to the top 4, 8, 16, or 32 players. There are
                        additional types of progression cuts detailed in the Fundamental Event Document, found
                        on the <em>X-Wing</em> page of the FFG website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a player qualified for a standings-based cut drops from the tournament before any games
                        are played during the next stage of the tournament, the next highest ranking player should
                        be added to the cut as the lowest ranked player in the cut.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Player drop example: <em>Steven finishes the Swiss rounds of a tournament in sixth place and
                        makes the top 8 cut but has a family emergency come up before the single elimination rounds
                        begin. He informs the organizer that he must leave the tournament and then departs. The
                        organizer immediately calls over the ninth place player, Eve, and informs her that she may
                        play in the top 8 due to someone leaving. She accepts and is entered into the top 8 as eighth
                        place. The former eighth place player moves to seventh place, and the former seventh place
                        player moves to Steven's spot at sixth place. Then the organizer pairs all eight players based
                        on these new rankings.</em>
                    </p>
                </span>
                <h4>Single Elimination Rounds</h4>
                <p>
                    Many X-Wing tournaments use single elimination <span class="updates">rounds, in which the winner of each pairing
                    remains in the tournament and the losing player is eliminated and dropped from the
                    tournament. Elimination rounds are usually used after a progression cut to the top 4, 8, 16,
                    or 32 players and continue until only one player remains and is named the winner.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first round of single elimination which follows a progression cut, pair the highest ranked
                    player against the lowest ranked player who made the cut. This is Game #1. Pair the secondhighest
                    player against the second-lowest player who made the cut. This is Game #2. Continue in
                    this manner until all players are paired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For tournaments which begin with single elimination rounds, byes will need to be utilized for the
                    first round if there are a number of players not equal to an exponential power of 2 (4, 8, 16, 32,
                    and so on). Randomly assign byes to a number of players equal to the difference between the
                    actual player count and the next-highest exponential power of 2. Then pair all remaining players
                    against each other at random. Assign each pairing and player with a bye a game number in a
                    random order, starting with Game #1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For additional elimination rounds, pair the winner of Game #1 against the winner of the last
                    pairing (the game with the highest number). This pairing is the new Game #1. If there are more
                    than two players remaining, pair the winner of Game #2 against the winner of the second-to-last
                    pairing (the game with the second highest number). This pairing is the new Game #2. Continue
                    in this manner until all players are paired for the round.
                </p>
                <span class="updates">
                    <p>
                        If a player drops from the tournament after single elimination rounds begin, that player's
                        current opponent-or next opponent, if the player drops between rounds-receives a bye
                        for the round.
                    </p>
                </span>
                <p>
                    In further single elimination rounds, follow the same method until all players are paired.
                </p>
                <h3>End of Round</h3>
                <p>
                    Each tournament round ends in one of the following ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>One Player Defeated</strong>: At the end of a game round, all of one player's ships are destroyed.
                        The player with at least one ship remaining immediately earns a win and the opposing
                        player receives a loss.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mutual Destruction</strong>: At the end of a game round, all of both players' ships are destroyed.
                        Players follow the rules for "Final Salvo" on page 15 using all of their ships to determine
                        the winner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Time</strong>: At the end of a game round, the round time limit has been reached. (If time is called
                        during a game round, players must finish that game round.) The player with the greater
                        score receives a win, and his opponent receives a loss. If both players have the same score,
                        they follow the rules for "Final Salvo" on page 15 to determine the winner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Concession</strong>: A player voluntarily concedes defeat at any point during the game. All of that
                        player's ships are destroyed. The conceding player receives a loss and his or her opponent
                        receives a win.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <span class="updates">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Going to time example</strong>: <em>Sal and Elaine are in the middle of the Activation Phase when the
                        round time limit is reached. They finish the game round through the End Phase, and then add
                        up their scores. Elaine destroyed 77 points of Sal's squad, while Sal destroyed 49 points of
                        Elaine's squad. Elaine has the higher score, so she receives the win and a Margin of Victory
                        of 128. Sal receives a loss and a Margin of Victory of 72.</em>
                    </p>
                </span>
                <h4>Calculating a Player's Score</h4>
                <p>
                    A player's score helps determine who won the game in certain circumstances and is used to
                    calculate Margin of Victory. Each player calculates their score by adding together the total squad
                    point value of their opponent's destroyed ships, including Upgrade cards equipped to those ships.
                    In addition, each player receives half the total squad point value (including Upgrade cards),
                    rounded down, of each enemy large ship whose combined total hull and shields, including any
                    Hull Upgrades or Shield Upgrades, have been reduced to half or below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a player destroys all of his or her opponent's ships, the opponent's squad is worth 100 squad
                    points for the purposes of calculating score, even if the total Ship and Upgrade cards are worth
                    fewer squad points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a player concedes the game, all of his or her remaining ships are destroyed before calculating
                    each player's score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Half points example</strong>: <em>Han Solo has no shields remaining and the "Direct Hit" Damage card
                    assigned to him. He has suffered 7 damage, which is more than half of his 13 available damage,
                    so he is worth half his total squad point value (including equipped Upgrade cards), rounded down.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Final Salvo</h4>
                <p>
                    If both players have the same score at the end of a game, they must fire a Final Salvo to
                    determine the winner. To fire a Final Salvo, each player adds together the printed, unmodified
                    primary weapon value of his or her remaining, undestroyed ships and rolls attack dice equal to
                    that number. The player who rolls the highest total number of combined hits and critical hits
                    wins the game. If both players roll an equal number hits and critical hits, they roll again until a
                    winner is determined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a game ends in mutual destruction, each player adds together the printed, unmodified primary
                    weapon value of all ships in his or her squad <span class="updates">and rolls attack dice equal to that number.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Tournament Points</h3>
                <p>
                    Players earn tournament points at the end of each round. At the end of a tournament, the player
                    with the most tournament points wins the tournament. In the case of a larger event, they are
                    instead used to determine who makes the cut to elimination rounds. Players earn tournament
                    points as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Win = 1 tournament point
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Loss = 0 tournament points
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Margin of Victory</h4>
                <p>
                    At the end of each game, the player with the higher score adds the amount by which his or her
                    score exceeds his or her opponent's score to 100. This number is that player's Margin of Victory
                    <span class="updates">("MoV")</span>. The player who has destroyed fewer squad points subtracts the same amount from 100
                    <span class="updates">to determine</span> his or her Margin of Victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>End of game example</strong>: <em>Bradley wins the game, destroying 100 squad points of his opponent's
                    ships. Bradley's opponent, Cara, has destroyed 24 points of Bradley's ships. Bradley wins by 76
                    points, which he adds to 100 for <span class="updates">an MoV</span> of 176. Cara loses by 76 points, which she subtracts
                    from 100 for <span class="updates">an MoV</span> of 24.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If both players have an identical score, each player receives a Margin of Victory of 100.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a player receives a bye, he or she receives a Margin of Victory of 150.
                </p>
                <h4>Tiebreakers</h4>
                <p>
                    If two or more players have the same number of tournament points,
                    tiebreakers are used to determine each player’s standing within that group.
                    Tiebreakers are used in the following order until all players within that group
                    have been given a standing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Margin of Victory</strong>: The player with the highest Margin of Victory is ranked above all
                        other players with the same number of tournament points. The player with the secondhighest
                        Margin of Victory is ranked second among those players. The player with the thirdhighest
                        Margin of Victory is ranked third among those players, and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strength of Schedule</strong>: A player's strength of schedule is calculated by dividing each
                        opponent's total tournament points by the number of rounds that opponent has played, adding
                        the results of each opponent played, and then dividing that total by the number of opponents
                        the player has played. The player with the highest strength of schedule is ranked above all
                        other players in the group not yet ranked. The player with the second-highest strength of
                        schedule is ranked second among all players in the group not yet ranked, and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Random</strong>: If any players are still tied after all other tiebreakers have been applied, then
                        those players are ranked in a random order below any players already ranked in the group.
                    </li>

                <h2>Tournament Structures</h2>
                <p>
                    The structure of a tournament determines how many Swiss and single elimination rounds are
                    used. All <em>X-Wing</em> tournaments must use one of the following three types.
                </p>
                <h3>Basic Structure</h3>
                    <p>
                        The basic tournament structure is designed to be very accessible, especially for newer
                        participants. This structure provides a tournament experience that requires a modest commitment
                        of time and resources from organizers and players. The Basic Structure is used for Store
                        Championship events.

                        Also included in the custom structure are tournaments that offer a number of rounds or size of
                        cut that does not change based on attendance. The Event Outline of official custom tournaments
                        will either include a specific structure tailored to that particular type of event or instruct the
                        organizer to design a structure and communicate it to participants. <span class="updates">The Custom Structure is used
                        for official Premier events, such as National, Continental, and World Championship events.</span>

                    <h2>Tournament Tiers</h2>
                    <p>
                        FFG’s OP events are broken into three tiers of play. These tiers serve to establish the
                        expectations of an <em>X-Wing</em> tournament. Expectations are not intended to exclude people from
                        participating, but to communicate the experience that players can expect from an event.
                        Organizers of unofficial tournaments are encouraged to utilize the Relaxed tier, unless their
                        tournament is specifically aimed at competitive players.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Relaxed</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tournaments at this level are welcoming to all players, regardless of experience level. Players are
                        encouraged to help each other improve and learn, so long as it does not significantly disrupt the
                        game. The focus is on creating a fun and friendly environment.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Formal</h3>
                    <p>
                        This tournament level expects players to posses at least a minimal amount of experience. Players
                        should be familiar with the game rules, and be prepared to exercise that knowledge to play at a
                        reasonable pace. Players are expected to avoid bumping ships and refrain from other sloppy play
                        mistakes. The focus is a friendly competitive environment.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Premier</h3>
                    <p>
                        Premier events are the highest level of competition for Fantasy Flight Games tournaments. At
                        this top level of tournaments, players are expected to have a moderate amount of experience.
                        Players should be familiar with not only the game rules, but also the FAQ and tournament
                        regulations. The focus is on a competitive and fair environment.
