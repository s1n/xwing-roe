                <p>
                    Read the Learn to Play booklet before reading this document. After reading
                    the Learn to Play booklet, players are ready to play their first game.
                    As questions arise during gameplay, players should reference this guide
                    instead of the Learn to Play booklet.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This guide is the definitive source for all <strong>X-Wing</strong>
                    rules. Unlike the Learn to Play booklet, this guide
                    addresses complex and unusual gameplay situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main component of this guide is a glossary of
                    important game terms, organized alphabetically. It
                    also includes optional rules, an index, and a Quick
                    Reference at the back of the booklet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules in this guide can be read by any player at any point.
                </p>

                <h3>Golden Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    If a rule in this guide contradicts the Learn to Play
                    booklet, the rule in this guide takes priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Card abilities can override the rules listed in this
                    guide. Mission rules can override both card abilities
                    and rules from this guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a card ability or mission effect uses the word
                    "cannot," that effect is absolute and cannot be
                    overridden by other effects.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Card Interpretations</h3>
                <p>
                    Many Ship card abilities use the word "you" to refer
                    to the corresponding ship. Upgrade and Damage
                    cards that use the word "you" refer to the ship to
                    which the card is assigned.

                <h3>Expansion Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    This reference is intended to be a comprehensive
                    document. It includes terms and concepts that
                    were introduced in expansion packs. The dagger (&dagger;)
                    character is used to indicate these terms; players
                    can ignore the marked entries unless they are playing
                    with expansion content that uses those terms.

                    in detail. If you are unable to find a topic in this

                <h3>Aquire A Target Lock</h3>
                <p>
                    Ships with the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-targetlock"></i> icon in their action bar may
                    perform the <strong>Acquire A Target Lock</strong> action to
                    acquire a target lock on an enemy ship at Range 1-3.
                    While attacking, a ship can spend a target lock that it
                    has on the defender to reroll any number of its attack
                    dice
                </p>
                <p>
                    A target lock consists of a red target lock token and
                    a blue target lock token displaying the same letter.
                    When a target lock is acquired, assign the blue
                    target lock token to the ship performing the action
                    (the locking ship), and assign the red target lock
                    token on the target (the locked ship).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Target locks are not removed during the End phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A ship can maintain one target lock. If a ship acquires
                    a new target lock, it must remove its old target lock.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship that does not have the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-targetlock"></i> icon in its
                        action bar can acquire and maintain a target lock
                        granted by another game effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a ship spends a target lock as part of the cost
                        of an ability, that target lock does not also allow
                        the ship to reroll attack dice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player declares an acquire a target lock
                        action for his ship and the enemy ship he wants
                        to lock is not at range, he may choose a different
                        ship to lock or a different action entirely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an ability instructs a ship to "acquire a target
                        lock," this is different than performing an acquire
                        a target lock action. The ship acquires the target
                        lock without performing an action, and it may do
                        so even if it has already performed the acquire a
                        target lock action this round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can acquire a new target lock on a ship
                        that it already has locked; the old target lock is
                        removed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can spend a target lock and choose not to
                        reroll any dice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an effect removes a blue or red target lock
                        token from a ship, the matching red or blue
                        target lock token is also removed (unless the blue
                        target lock is assigned to another ship).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can be locked by more than one enemy ship.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Actions</h3>
                <p>
                    The active ship can perform one standard action
                    during the "Perform Action" step of the Activation
                    phase. Ships can also perform free actions as
                    instructed by cards or mission rules. The actions
                    available to each ship are listed in that ship's action
                    bar.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As an action, a ship may resolve an ability
                        beginning with the "<strong>Action:</strong>" header on one of its
                        Upgrade or Damage cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot perform actions, even free actions,
                        while stressed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship must skip its "Perform Action" step if
                        it overlapped another ship while executing a maneuver.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot perform the same action more
                        than once during a single round, even if one or
                        more of the actions are free actions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If a ship has more than one copy of the same
                                Damage or Upgrade card, it still cannot
                                perform the action described on those cards
                                more than once per round.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a card ability or mission effect grants a ship
                        a free action for which it does not have the
                        matching action icon in its action bar, it may still
                        perform that action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can choose not to perform an action
                        during the "Perform Action" step or when granted
                        a free action.
                    </li>

                <h3>Activation Phase</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Activation phase, each ship is activated
                    one at a time, starting with the ship with the lowest
                    pilot skill and continuing in ascending order. Each ship
                    resolves the following steps in order:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reveal Dial:</strong> Reveal the ship's dial and take
                        the maneuver template that matches the chosen
                        maneuver.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Execute Maneuver:</strong> Resolve the following
                        substeps in order:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Move Ship:</strong> Slide the maneuver template
                                between the front guides of the ship's base
                                so that it is flush against the base. Then pick
                                up the ship and place it at the opposite end
                                of the template, sliding the rear guides of the
                                base into the opposite end of the template.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Check Pilot Stress:</strong> If the maneuver is
                                red, assign one stress token to the ship; if
                                the maneuver is green, remove one stress
                                token from the ship.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Clean Up:</strong> Return the maneuver template
                                to the pile of maneuver templates. Place the
                                revealed dial outside the play area next to
                                the ship's Ship card.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <strong>Perform Action:</strong> The ship may perform one action.

                <p>
                    A ship's agility is the green number on its Ship card.
                    It indicates the number of defense dice the ship rolls
                    when defending.

                        A ship with an agility value of "0" can still roll
                        additional defense dice granted by range combat
                        bonuses, obstructed attacks, card abilities, etc.

                        All modifiers to agility are cumulative. After all

                <p>
                    A ship can perform one attack when it becomes the
                    active ship during the Combat phase. To perform an
                    attack, the ship resolves the following steps in order:

                    <li>
                        <strong>Declare Target</strong>: The attacker may measure
                        range to any number of enemy ships and check
                        which enemy ships are inside his firing arc. Then
                        the attacker chooses one of his weapons to
                        attack with. Then he chooses one enemy ship to
                        be the target and pays any costs required for the
                        attack.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If attacking with a primary weapon, the target
                                must be inside the attacker's firing arc and at
                                Range 1-3.

                            <li>
                                If attacking with a turret primary weapon, the
                                target must be at Range 1-3 but does not need
                                to be inside firing arc.
                            </li>

                                must be inside the attacker's firing arc (unless
                                otherwise specified) and at the weapon range
                                indicated on the weapon's Upgrade card.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon,
                                or if the attacker cannot pay any costs required
                                for the attack, the attacker may choose a
                                different weapon and target.
                            </li>

                                After a valid weapon and target are chosen
                                and any indicated costs are paid, the target is
                                considered to be the defender.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Roll Attack Dice</strong>: The attacker rolls a
                        number of attack dice equal to its primary
                        weapon value; if it is attacking with a secondary
                        weapon, it rolls attack dice equal to the attack

                                the attacker rolls one additional attack die.

                                 rolls the attack dice.

                        <strong>Modify Attack Dice</strong>: The defender can
                        resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify
                        the attack dice. Then the attacker can modify his

                <p>
                    Some ships have an auxiliary firing arc identified by
                    dotted lines printed on its ship token. These ships
                    also have a unique primary weapon icon printed on
                    their Ship cards. When attacking with its primary
                    weapon, a ship with this icon may attack an enemy
                    ship that is at Range 1-3 and inside its standard or
                    auxiliary firing arc.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        When attacking with a secondary weapon, the
                        ship must still target an enemy ship inside its
                        standard firing arc (unless otherwise specified on
                        the Upgrade card).

                <h3>Barrel Roll</h3>
                <p>
                    Ships with the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-barrelroll"></i> icon in their action bar may
                    perform the barrel roll action to move laterally and
                    adjust their position. To perform a barrel roll with a
                    small ship, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Take the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 1] maneuver template.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place one end of the template against the left or
                        right side of the ship's base. The template cannot
                        be placed beyond the front or back edges of the
                        base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lift the ship off the play surface, then place
                        the ship at the other end of the template. The
                        template cannot be beyond the front or back
                        edges of the ship's base, and the ship must face
                        in the same direction as before the barrel roll.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot barrel roll if it would overlap
                        another ship or an obstacle token, or if the
                        maneuver template would overlap an obstacle
                        token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot barrel roll if this would cause the
                        ship to flee the battlefield.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a player declares a barrel roll action for
                        his ship, he must also declare whether the ship
                        is barrel rolling to the left or to the right before
                        placing the maneuver template on the play area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player declares a barrel roll action for his
                        ship and cannot complete the action in the
                        desired direction, he may choose a different
                        direction or a different action entirely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Performing a barrel roll does not count as
                        executing a maneuver.

                        bearings advance a ship at a tight curve to one

                        advances a ship straight forward, changing its
                        facing by 180&deg;. To achieve this facing, the player
                        slides the ship's front guides into the end of the
                        maneuver template instead of the rear guides.

                        facing by 225&deg;. To achieve this facing, the player
                        slides the ship's front guides into the end of the
                        maneuver template instead of the rear guides.

                        Roll right (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-trollright"></i>) bearings advance a ship at a tight
                        curve to one side, sharply changing its facing
                        by 180&deg;. To achieve this facing, before the
                        player places the ship at the opposite end of the
                        template, he rotates the ship 90&deg; to the left for a

                        right. The side of the ship's base must be placed
                        flush against the end of the maneuver template,
                        and the end of the template cannot extend

                        <strong>Stationary</strong>: The stationary (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-stop"></i>) bearing does
                        not have a corresponding maneuver template
                        and is always paired with a speed value of "0"
                        to indicate that the ship does not move from its
                        current position.

                    <li>
                        If a ship overlaps another ship while executing
                        a Koiogran turn or a Segnor's Loop, the ship
                        does not rotate 180&deg; at the opposite end of the
                        template. The player places the ship using the
                        rear guides instead of the front guides.

                    <li>
                        When a ship executes a Tallon Roll, it must avoid
                        overlapping other ships if possible. If the ship
                        cannot avoid overlapping another ship, it does not
                        rotate 90&deg; at the end of the template.
