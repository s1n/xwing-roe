                <p>
                    Read the Learn to Play booklet before reading this document. After reading
                    the Learn to Play booklet, players are ready to play their first game.
                    As questions arise during gameplay, players should reference this guide
                    instead of the Learn to Play booklet.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This guide is the definitive source for all <strong>X-Wing</strong>
                    rules. Unlike the Learn to Play booklet, this guide
                    addresses complex and unusual gameplay situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main component of this guide is a glossary of
                    important game terms, organized alphabetically. It
                    also includes optional rules, an index, and a Quick
                    Reference at the back of the booklet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules in this guide can be read by any player at any point.
                </p>

                <h3>Golden Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    If a rule in this guide contradicts the Learn to Play
                    booklet, the rule in this guide takes priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Card abilities can override the rules listed in this
                    guide. Mission rules can override both card abilities
                    and rules from this guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a card ability or mission effect uses the word
                    "cannot," that effect is absolute and cannot be
                    overridden by other effects.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Card Interpretations</h3>
                <p>
                    Many Ship card abilities use the word "you" to refer
                    to the corresponding ship. Upgrade and Damage
                    cards that use the word "you" refer to the ship to
                    which the card is assigned.

                <h3>Expansion Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    This reference is intended to be a comprehensive
                    document. It includes terms and concepts that
                    were introduced in expansion packs. The dagger (&dagger;)
                    character is used to indicate these terms; players
                    can ignore the marked entries unless they are playing
                    with expansion content that uses those terms.

                    in detail. If you are unable to find a topic in this

                <h3>Aquire A Target Lock</h3>
                <p>
                    Ships with the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-targetlock"></i> icon in their action bar may
                    perform the <strong>Acquire A Target Lock</strong> action to
                    acquire a target lock on an enemy ship at Range 1-3.
                    While attacking, a ship can spend a target lock that it
                    has on the defender to reroll any number of its attack
                    dice
                </p>
                <p>
                    A target lock consists of a red target lock token and
                    a blue target lock token displaying the same letter.
                    When a target lock is acquired, assign the blue
                    target lock token to the ship performing the action
                    (the locking ship), and assign the red target lock
                    token on the target (the locked ship).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Target locks are not removed during the End phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A ship can maintain one target lock. If a ship acquires
                    a new target lock, it must remove its old target lock.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship that does not have the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-targetlock"></i> icon in its
                        action bar can acquire and maintain a target lock
                        granted by another game effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a ship spends a target lock as part of the cost
                        of an ability, that target lock does not also allow
                        the ship to reroll attack dice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player declares an acquire a target lock
                        action for his ship and the enemy ship he wants
                        to lock is not at range, he may choose a different
                        ship to lock or a different action entirely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an ability instructs a ship to "acquire a target
                        lock," this is different than performing an acquire
                        a target lock action. The ship acquires the target
                        lock without performing an action, and it may do
                        so even if it has already performed the acquire a
                        target lock action this round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can acquire a new target lock on a ship
                        that it already has locked; the old target lock is
                        removed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can spend a target lock and choose not to
                        reroll any dice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an effect removes a blue or red target lock
                        token from a ship, the matching red or blue
                        target lock token is also removed (unless the blue
                        target lock is assigned to another ship).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can be locked by more than one enemy ship.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Actions</h3>
                <p>
                    The active ship can perform one standard action
                    during the "Perform Action" step of the Activation
                    phase. Ships can also perform free actions as
                    instructed by cards or mission rules. The actions
                    available to each ship are listed in that ship's action
                    bar.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As an action, a ship may resolve an ability
                        beginning with the "<strong>Action:</strong>" header on one of its
                        Upgrade or Damage cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot perform actions, even free actions,
                        while stressed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship must skip its "Perform Action" step if
                        it overlapped another ship while executing a maneuver.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot perform the same action more
                        than once during a single round, even if one or
                        more of the actions are free actions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If a ship has more than one copy of the same
                                Damage or Upgrade card, it still cannot
                                perform the action described on those cards
                                more than once per round.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a card ability or mission effect grants a ship
                        a free action for which it does not have the
                        matching action icon in its action bar, it may still
                        perform that action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can choose not to perform an action
                        during the "Perform Action" step or when granted
                        a free action.
                    </li>

                <h3>Activation Phase</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Activation phase, each ship is activated
                    one at a time, starting with the ship with the lowest
                    pilot skill and continuing in ascending order. Each ship
                    resolves the following steps in order:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reveal Dial:</strong> Reveal the ship's dial and take
                        the maneuver template that matches the chosen
                        maneuver.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Execute Maneuver:</strong> Resolve the following
                        substeps in order:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Move Ship:</strong> Slide the maneuver template
                                between the front guides of the ship's base
                                so that it is flush against the base. Then pick
                                up the ship and place it at the opposite end
                                of the template, sliding the rear guides of the
                                base into the opposite end of the template.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Check Pilot Stress:</strong> If the maneuver is
                                red, assign one stress token to the ship; if
                                the maneuver is green, remove one stress
                                token from the ship.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Clean Up:</strong> Return the maneuver template
                                to the pile of maneuver templates. Place the
                                revealed dial outside the play area next to
                                the ship's Ship card.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <strong>Perform Action:</strong> The ship may perform one action.

                <p>
                    A ship's agility is the green number on its Ship card.
                    It indicates the number of defense dice the ship rolls
                    when defending.

                        A ship with an agility value of "0" can still roll
                        additional defense dice granted by range combat
                        bonuses, obstructed attacks, card abilities, etc.

                        All modifiers to agility are cumulative. After all

                <p>
                    A ship can perform one attack when it becomes the
                    active ship during the Combat phase. To perform an
                    attack, the ship resolves the following steps in order:

                    <li>
                        <strong>Declare Target</strong>: The attacker may measure
                        range to any number of enemy ships and check
                        which enemy ships are inside his firing arc. Then
                        the attacker chooses one of his weapons to
                        attack with. Then he chooses one enemy ship to
                        be the target and pays any costs required for the
                        attack.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If attacking with a primary weapon, the target
                                must be inside the attacker's firing arc and at
                                Range 1-3.

                            <li>
                                If attacking with a turret primary weapon, the
                                target must be at Range 1-3 but does not need
                                to be inside firing arc.
                            </li>

                                must be inside the attacker's firing arc (unless
                                otherwise specified) and at the weapon range
                                indicated on the weapon's Upgrade card.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon,
                                or if the attacker cannot pay any costs required
                                for the attack, the attacker may choose a
                                different weapon and target.
                            </li>

                                After a valid weapon and target are chosen
                                and any indicated costs are paid, the target is
                                considered to be the defender.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Roll Attack Dice</strong>: The attacker rolls a
                        number of attack dice equal to its primary
                        weapon value; if it is attacking with a secondary
                        weapon, it rolls attack dice equal to the attack

                                the attacker rolls one additional attack die.

                                 rolls the attack dice.

                        <strong>Modify Attack Dice</strong>: The defender can
                        resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify
                        the attack dice. Then the attacker can modify his

                <p>
                    Some ships have an auxiliary firing arc identified by
                    dotted lines printed on its ship token. These ships
                    also have a unique primary weapon icon printed on
                    their Ship cards. When attacking with its primary
                    weapon, a ship with this icon may attack an enemy
                    ship that is at Range 1-3 and inside its standard or
                    auxiliary firing arc.

                        When attacking with a secondary weapon, the
                        ship must still target an enemy ship inside its
                        standard firing arc (unless otherwise specified on
                        the Upgrade card).

                <p>
                    Ships with the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-barrelroll"></i> icon in their action bar may
                    perform the barrel roll action to move laterally and
                    adjust their position. To perform a barrel roll with a
                    small ship, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Take the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 1] maneuver template.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place one end of the template against the left or
                        right side of the ship's base. The template cannot
                        be placed beyond the front or back edges of the
                        base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lift the ship off the play surface, then place
                        the ship at the other end of the template. The
                        template cannot be beyond the front or back
                        edges of the ship's base, and the ship must face
                        in the same direction as before the barrel roll.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot barrel roll if it would overlap
                        another ship or an obstacle token, or if the
                        maneuver template would overlap an obstacle
                        token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot barrel roll if this would cause the
                        ship to flee the battlefield.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a player declares a barrel roll action for
                        his ship, he must also declare whether the ship
                        is barrel rolling to the left or to the right before
                        placing the maneuver template on the play area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player declares a barrel roll action for his
                        ship and cannot complete the action in the
                        desired direction, he may choose a different
                        direction or a different action entirely

                    <li>
                        Performing a barrel roll does not count as

                <p>
                    Ships with the <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-boost"></i> icon in their action bar may
                    perform a boost action. To boost, follow these steps:

                    <li>

                        Set the maneuver template between the ship's front guides.

                    <li>
                        Move the ship to the opposite end of the
                        template and slide the rear guides of the ship
                        into the template.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot boost if it would overlap another
                        ship or an obstacle token, or if the maneuver
                        template would overlap an obstacle token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot boost if this would cause the ship

                    <li>
                        When a player declares a boost action for his
                        ship, he must also declare which direction he is
                        boosting before determining if he can complete
                        the boost in that direction.

                <p>
                    When a die result is canceled, a player takes one die
                    displaying the canceled result and physically removes
                    the die from the common area. Players ignore all

                        A card ability cannot be resolved more than
                        once during the timing specified on the card.
                        For example, a card with the timing of "when
                        defending" cannot be resolved twice by the
                        defender during a single attack.

                    <li>
                        The word "you" on a Ship card refers to the
                        corresponding ship. Abilities on Ship cards
                        cannot affect other ships unless the ability
                        specifies otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The word "you" on Damage cards and Upgrade
                        cards refers to the ship that has those cards.
                        These cards only affect the ship that they are
                        assigned to unless the card specifies otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unless a card ability uses the word "may" or has
                        the "<strong>Action:</strong>" or "<strong>Attack:</strong>" headers, the ability
                        is mandatory and must be resolved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If multiple abilities resolve at the same time, the
                        player with initiative chooses which of his abilities
                        to resolve and resolves them in the order of his
                        choosing. Then the opposing player does the
                        same for his own abilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a ship is equipped with more than one copy of
                        the same Upgrade card that does not require an
                        action to trigger the card's ability, it can trigger
                        each copy of that card at the specified timing.

                        When a ship is destroyed, its card abilities are
                        no longer active. The exceptions to this rule are
                        card abilities whose effects have already been
                        triggered and specify a time when the effect
                        ends, such as "until the end of the Combat phase."

                    <li>
                        While a ship has a cloak token, it cannot perform attacks.

                    <li>
                        A ship cannot perform the cloak action while it
                        already has a cloak token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cloak tokens are not removed during the End phase.

                <p>
                    At the start of the Activation phase, after players
                    have resolved all other abilities that trigger at the
                    start of the Activation phase, each ship may spend a
                    cloak token to decloak, starting with the ship with the
                    lowest pilot skill (using initiative to break ties).

                <p>
                    When a ship decloaks, it must choose one of the

                    highest pilot skill and continuing in descending order.

                    <li>
                        If a player has multiple ships with the same pilot
                        skill value, he can attack with them in any order.
                    </li>

                        If both players have ships with the same pilot skill
                        value, the player with initiative attacks with all of

                <p>
                    During an attack, a ship suffers one critical damage for
                    each uncanceled <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i> result. If a ship is dealt a Damage
                    card due to suffering critical damage, that card is
                    dealt faceup and its text immediately resolves.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The effect of a faceup Damage card is ongoing
                        until the card is discarded or flipped facedown.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a ship is dealt a faceup Damage card,
                        assign a critical hit token to that ship as a
                        reminder of the card's ongoing effect. That token
                        is discarded if the card is discarded or flipped facedown.

                    <li>
                        Each faceup Damage card has either the <strong>Ship</strong> or
                        <strong>Pilot</strong> trait. These traits have no inherent effect,
                        but they may be referenced by other effects.

                <h3>Damage</h3>
                <p>
                    During the "Deal Damage" step of an attack, a ship
                    suffers one damage for each uncanceled <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> result
                    and one critical damage for each uncanceled <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i>
                    result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a ship suffers a damage or critical damage, it
                    loses one shield token. If it does not have any shield
                    tokens to lose, it is dealt one Damage card instead.
                    For normal damage, the Damage card is dealt
                    facedown; for critical damage, the Damage card is
                    dealt faceup and the text on the card immediately resolves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a ship has a number of Damage cards equal to its
                    hull value, it is destroyed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When a ship suffers damage or critical damage,
                        its hull value is not reduced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a ship is destroyed, its Damage cards are
                        discarded faceup to the discard pile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players can look at the Damage card discard pile
                        at any time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the Damage deck is empty when a Damage
                        card must be dealt or drawn, shuffle the discard
                        pile to create a new Damage deck.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If both the Damage deck and discard pile are
                        empty, players cannot draw Damage cards from
                        the deck. If a Damage card must be dealt, the
                        players should use a suitable counter (such as
                        a coin or bead) in place of Damage cards until
                        some Damage cards become available to create
                        a deck at the end of the round. Treat all counters
                        as facedown Damage cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an effect instructs a player to deal a Damage
                        card to a ship, this is different from the ship
                        suffering damage. The card is dealt to the ship
                        regardless of whether the ship has any shield
                        tokens remaining.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a ship would be dealt more Damage cards than
                        are needed to destroy it, those cards are still
                        dealt. A ship that is kept in the play area by the
                        Simultaneous Attack Rule is affected by all of its
                        faceup Damage cards regardless of whether they
                        are excess.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a Damage card is flipped faceup, it is not
                        treated as being dealt. Flipping a Damage card
                        faceup does not trigger abilities related to dealing
                        a Damage card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the players have more than one Damage deck,
                        they should not shuffle them together. Instead,
                        each player uses his own Damage deck and
                        discard pile and does not assign his own Damage
                        cards to any enemy ships.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Damage deck included in this box replaces
                        the Damage deck included in the original <strong><em>X-Wing</em></strong>
                        core set. If players have both, they should use the
                        new deck included in this box.

                    "Declare Target" step of an attack is the defender.

                <p>
                    A ship is destroyed when it has a number of Damage
                    cards equal to its hull value or when it flees the
                    battlefield. When a ship is destroyed, remove it from
                    the play area, discard all of its Damage cards, and
                    return all of its tokens to the supply.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                         If the Simultaneous Attack Rule delays a ship's
                         destruction, it is instead destroyed after it has
                         had its opportunity to attack this round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The "Direct Hit!" Damage card counts as two
                        Damage cards for the purpose of determining if a
                        ship is destroyed.

                <p>
                    The results on the attack dice are as follows:

                        Critical (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i>): If this result is not canceled, the
                        defender suffers one critical damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Focus (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i>): These results have no inherent
                        effect, but the attacker may spend a focus token
                        to change them to <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> results.
                    </li>

                        Blank: This result does not display any icons. It
                        has no effect.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The results on the defense dice are as follows:

                        Evade (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i>): This result cancels one <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> or <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i>
                        result.
                    </li>

                        Focus (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i>): These results have no inherent
                        effect, but the defender may spend a focus token
                        to change them to <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i> results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blank: This result does not display any icons. It

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When an effect instructs a player to roll dice for
                    a purpose other than resolving an attack, the dice
                    results have no inherent effect.

                <h3>Difficulty</h3>
                <p>
                    The difficulty of a maneuver is indicated by the color
                    of the bearing icon. When a ship executes a red
                    maneuver, it receives one stress token. When a ship
                    executes a green maneuver, remove one stress token
                    from it. White maneuvers have no inherent effect.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot execute a red maneuver while
                        it is stressed. If a stressed ship reveals a red
                        maneuver, the opposing player chooses any nonred
                        maneuver on that ship's dial for the ship to
                        execute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can have more than one stress token assigned to it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If two game effects conflict in changing the
                        difficulty of a maneuver, the effect that makes the
                        maneuver more difficult takes priority. The other
                        effect is ignored.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Ships with the evade (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i>) icon in their action bar may
                    perform the evade action. To perform the action,
                    assign one evade token to the ship. When defending,
                    the ship may spend that token to add one additional
                    evade (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i>) result to his defense roll. All unspent evade
                    tokens are removed from ships during the End phase.

                    <li>
                        A ship can have more than one evade token.

                        If an ability instructs a player to assign an evade
                        token to a ship, this is different than performing
                        an evade action. The ship is assigned the token
                        without performing an action and may still
                        perform the evade action this round.

                <p>
                    There are three primary factions in the game: Rebel
                    (The Rebel Alliance and The Resistance), Imperial
                    (The Galactic Empire and The First Order), and Scum
                    (Scum and Villainy). All Ship cards and some Upgrade
                    cards are aligned to one of these primary factions.
                    A squad cannot contain cards from different primary
                    factions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Upgrade cards are neutral unless they have a
                        trait that restricts them to a primary faction.
                        Neutral Upgrade cards are not aligned to a
                        faction and can be fielded in any squad.

                    A ship's primary firing arc is the area formed by
                    extending the firing arc lines printed on the front of
                    the ship's token. A firing arc extends across the play
                    area. A ship is inside a firing arc if any part of its
                    base falls inside the area formed by extending the
                    firing-arc lines.

                        A ship's primary firing arc is used for all attacks,

                <h3>Fleeing The Battlefield</h3>
                <p>
                    When a ship executes a maneuver or performs an
                    action that changes its position, if <strong>any part</strong> of
                    its base is outside the play area, that ship has fled
                    the battlefield. A ship that flees the battlefield is
                    destroyed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a ship executes a maneuver or performs an
                        action that changes its position, the ship is not
                        destroyed if only its maneuver template is outside
                        the play area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a ship is placed outside the play area as a
                        result of executing a maneuver, the ship flees
                        the battlefield and is immediately destroyed. It
                        cannot perform an action or execute a maneuver
                        to move back within the play area.

                    <li>
                        If a ship unexpectedly ends its maneuver outside
                        the play area due to overlapping other ships, it
                        still flees the battlefield and is destroyed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a ship flees the battlefield, it is
                        immediately destroyed and removed from the
                        play area. It cannot resolve any of its Ship or
                        Upgrade card abilities.

                <h3>Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    Ships with the focus (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i>) icon in their action bar
                    may perform the focus action. To perform the action,
                    assign one focus token to the ship. When attacking or
                    defending, the ship may spend that token to change
                    all of its <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results to <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> results (on attack dice) or
                    <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i> results (on defense dice). All unspent focus tokens
                    are removed from ships during the End phase.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship can have more than one focus token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can spend a focus token even if it did not
                        roll any <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a card ability instructs a player to assign
                        a focus token to a ship, this is different than
                        performing a focus action. The ship is assigned
                        the token without performing an action and may
                        still perform the focus action this round.

                    There are three formats of play as described below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Standard Play</strong>: This format is the standard
                        dogfight with a recommended squad point total of
                        100 points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cinematic Play</strong>: This format uses missions to
                        create scenarios with special objectives.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h3>Free Actions</h3>
                <p>
                    A free action is an action granted to a ship through a
                    card ability or other effect. It does not count as the
                    one standard action that a ship performs during the
                    "Perform Action" step.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A stressed ship cannot perform free actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship can perform free actions even if it skipped
                        its "Perform Action" step due to overlapping an
                        asteroid obstacle or another game effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a ship is specifically granted a free barrel
                        roll action or a free boost action and cannot
                        complete the action in the desired direction,
                        it may choose a different direction. It cannot
                        choose to perform a different action

                    <li>
                        A ship is friendly to itself and can affect itself with
                        any of its abilities that affect friendly ships unless

                <p>
                    Each ship's base has two pairs of movement guides,
                    one pair on the front and one pair on the back. These
                    guides are ignored for all purposes except executing
                    maneuvers and overlapping obstacles and other
                    ships. In those cases, the guides count as part of the base.

                    The yellow number on a ship's Ship card is its hull
                    value. The hull value indicates how many Damage
                    cards must be dealt to it to destroy it.

                <h3>ID Tokens</h3>
                <p>
                    ID Tokens identify which ships in the play area
                    correspond to which Ship card. If a player fields
                    multiple copies of the same non-unique Ship card, he
                    must assign a different set of ID tokens to each of
                    those ships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To assign an ID token to a ship, the player places one
                    ID token on the ship's Ship card. Then he inserts two
                    more ID tokens into the tower of the ship's base; the
                    sides facing outward must match the color of the
                    faceup token on the Ship card.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If both players field squads of the same faction,
                        they are playing a mirror match. Before starting
                        a mirror match, the players must assign ID
                        tokens to each of their ships. One player displays
                        his ID tokens with the white numbers facing
                        outward; the other player displays his tokens with
                        the black numbers facing outward.

                    The player whose squad has the lowest total squad
                    point cost chooses which player has initiative. If they
                    are tied for squad point cost, one player rolls an
                    attack die. On a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> or <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i> result, that player chooses
                    who has initiative. On a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> or blank result, his
                    opponent chooses who has initiative.

                        During the Activation phase, if both players have

                        belonging to the player with initiative activate first.

                    Some card abilities can cause a ship to receive an
                    ion token. A ship is ionized while it has an ion token
                    assigned to it. An ionized ship follows special rules
                    during the following phases:

                <p>
                    A large ship uses a plastic base that is about 3-1/8"
                    (8 cm) long. Large ships follow all of the rules of
                    small ships with the following exceptions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A large ship is unaffected by a single ion token;
                        the ion token simply remains assigned to the ship.
                        When a large ship has two or more ion tokens
                        assigned to it, it suffers the ion token effect as
                        normal and the player removes all ion tokens from
                        the ship after it executes a maneuver.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a large ship performs a barrel roll, instead
                        of placing the end of the template against the
                        ship's base, place the long side of the template
                        against the ship's base. All other rules for
                        performing a barrel roll apply as normal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During setup, a large ship's base may extend
                        outside of Range 1 (or a mission's specified setup
                        area) as long as it fills the length of that area. A
                        large ship cannot be placed with any portion of its
                        base outside the play area.

                <p>
                    Each selection on the maneuver dial is a single
                    maneuver, which consists of a speed (number), a
                    bearing (arrow), and a difficulty (color). Ships execute
                    maneuvers during the Activation phase by resolving
                    the "Execute Maneuver" step.

                        When an ability instructs a ship to execute a
                        specific maneuver, it resolves only the "Execute
                        Maneuver" step of the Activation phase.

                    <li>
                        When a ship executes a maneuver, it is picked
                        up from its starting position and placed in its
                        final position. The full width of the ship's base is
                        ignored except in its starting and final positions.

                <p>
                    Players can modify dice by spending focus, evade,
                    and target lock tokens and by resolving card abilities.
                    Dice can be modified in the following ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Add</strong>: To add a die result, place an unused die
                        displaying the result next to the rolled dice. A die
                        added in this way is treated as a normal die for
                        all purposes and can be modified and canceled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Change</strong>: To change a die result, rotate the die
                        so that its faceup side displays the new result.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reroll</strong>: To reroll a die result, pick up the die and
                        roll it again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dice can be modified by multiple effects, but a die
                        cannot be rerolled more than once.

                <h3>Moving Through</h3>
                <p>
                    When executing a maneuver, a ship moves through
                    an obstacle or another ship if its maneuver template
                    overlaps that obstacle token or that ship's base. A
                    ship can move through another ship without issue,
                    but moving through an obstacles produces the
                    effects described in the "Obstacles" section.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a ship moves through another ship, the player
                        should hold the maneuver template above the
                        other ship and make his best estimation of where
                        the moving ship should end its movement.

                                If the players desire greater precision, they
                                can mark the positions of intervening ships,
                                remove those ships to complete the maneuver,
                                then return those ships to their marked
                                positions (maintaining facing).

                <p>
                    Obstacles acts as hazards that can disrupt and
                    damage ships. When a ship executes a maneuver, if
                    its base or maneuver template overlaps an obstacle
                    token, it executes its maneuver as normal but suffers
                    an effect based on the type of obstacle:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Asteroid</strong>: The ship must skip its "Perform
                        Action" step this round. After skipping the
                        "Perform Action" step, it rolls one attack die. On
                        a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> result, the ship suffers one damage; on a
                        <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i> result, it suffers one critical damage. While a
                        ship is overlapping an asteroid, it cannot perform
                        any attacks.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Debris Cloud&dagger;</strong>: After the "Check Pilot Stress"
                        step, the ship receives one stress token. After
                        the "Perform Action" step, it rolls one attack
                        die. On a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-crit"></i> result, the ship suffers one critical
                        damage. The ship can still perform attacks.

                        starting and final positions of the ship is counted

                        If a ship moves through or overlaps more than

                        to a point of the defender's base that is not the
                        closest point in order to avoid measuring through
                        an obstacle. If multiple points are at equal
                        distance from the attacker, he may choose one of
                        those lines for measuring range.

                <h3>Overlapping Ships</h3>
                <p>
                    A ship overlaps another ship when executing a
                    maneuver if its base overlaps the other ship's base. If
                    this happens, move the moving ship backward along
                    the template until it is no longer overlapping another
                    ship. While doing so, adjust the facing of the ship so
                    that the template remains centered between both
                    sets of guides on the ship's base. Once the ship is no
                    longer overlapping another ship, place it so that it is
                    touching the last ship it overlapped. The ship must
                    skip its "Perform Action" step this round.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While a ship is touching another ship, those ships
                        cannot attack each other. They can still attack
                        enemy ships that they are not touching.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship may still perform free actions even if it
                        overlapped another ship.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When executing a maneuver, if a ship overlaps
                        more than one ship, it is treated as having
                        overlapped only the ship or ships that it is
                        touching in its final position.

                <p>
                    A ship's pilot skill is the orange number to the
                    left of the ship's name on its Ship card. Pilot skill
                    determines the order in which ships move during
                    the Activation phase and attack during the Combat
                    phase, as well as the order in which ships are placed
                    during setup.

                    <li>
                        If several game effects alter the pilot skill of a
                        ship, only the most recent effect is applied.

                                "at the end of the Combat phase"), the ship's
                                pilot skill returns to the pilot skill established
                                by the most recent effect that is still active.

                <p>
                    During the Planning phase, each player secretly
                    chooses a maneuver for each of his ships. To choose
                    a maneuver, the player rotates the faceplate of the
                    ship's maneuver dial until the window shows only the
                    desired maneuver. Then he assigns the maneuver by
                    placing the dial facedown in the play area next to the
                    matching ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phase ends when each ship has a dial assigned
                    to it and neither player wishes to change one of his
                    chosen maneuvers.

                <p>
                    The play area is the defined area on a flat surface in
                    which the ships are placed and maneuvered. If any
                    part of a ship's base is outside the play area, that
                    ship has fled the battlefield.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recommended play area is 3' x 3' (0.9144 m) for
                    a standard 100-point dogfight. If playing with squads
                    greater or less than 100 squad points, the players
                    can expand or contract the play area in one or both
                    dimensions to create a suitable space for the game.

                    <li>
                        The play area for all missions is 3' x 3' unless the
                        mission specifies otherwise.

                <p>
                    A ship's primary weapon value is the red number
                    on its Ship card. This value indicates how many
                    attack dice the ship rolls when attacking during the
                    "Roll Attack Dice" step unless it is attacking with a
                    secondary weapon.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        During a primary weapon attack, the attacker or
                        defender may add range combat bonuses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship with a primary weapon value of "0" can
                        still roll additional attack dice granted by range
                        combat bonuses and card abilities.

                    <li>
                        All modifiers to a ship's primary weapon value are
                        cumulative. After all modifiers have been applied,
                        if a ship's primary weapon value is less than "0,"
                        it is treated as "0."

                <h3>Range</h3>
                <p>
                    Range is the distance between two ships as
                    measured by the range ruler, which is divided into
                    three range bands. To measure range between two
                    ships, place the range ruler over the point of the first
                    ship that is closest to the second ship, then point the
                    other end of the ruler toward the point of the second
                    ship's base that is closest to the first base. The
                    range is the band of the range ruler that falls over
                    the closest point of the second ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When measuring range for an attack, the attacker
                    measures to the closest point of the target ship that
                    is <strong>inside</strong> the attacker's firing arc.

                <h3>Secondary Weapons</h3>
                <p>
                    Secondary weapons are upgrades that feature the
                    "<strong>Attack:</strong>" header in their card text. They provide
                    additional types of attack other than a ship's primary
                    weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use a secondary weapon, the attacker must meet
                    all requirements indicated in the card's text, and the
                    desired target must be inside the attacker's firing arc
                    and at the weapon range specified on the card. If all
                    requirements are met, the attacker can declare that
                    it is using the secondary weapon during the "Declare

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    Before playing, set up the game as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gather Forces</strong>: The players reveal their
                        squads and gather all of the ships, cards, and
                        other components necessary for their squads.
                        Each ship in the squad must have the correct
                        plastic ship, ship token, maneuver dial, Ship card,
                        and any Upgrade cards chosen, as well as ID
                        tokens if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Determine Initiative</strong>: The player with the
                        lowest squad point total chooses which player
                        has initiative. If players are tied, the players
                        randomly determine which player chooses who
                        has initiative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Establish Play Area</strong>: Establish a 3' x 3'
                        (0.9144 m) play area (or alternative size) on a
                        flat surface such as a table or playmat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Place Obstacles</strong>: Starting with the player
                        with initiative, each player chooses one obstacle
                        token from the obstacles available and places it
                        in the play area. The players place a total of six
                        obstacle tokens. Obstacles cannot be placed at
                        Range 1 of each other, or at Range 1–2 of an
                        edge of the play area. After the sixth obstacle is
                        placed, the player who does not have initiative
                        chooses an edge of the play area to be his own;
                        his opponent's edge is the opposite side of the
                        play area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Place Forces</strong>: The players place their ships
                        into the play area in order from lowest pilot skill
                        to highest pilot skill. If multiple ships tie in pilot
                        skill, the player with initiative places his ships
                        with that pilot skill first. Ships must be placed
                        within Range 1 of their player's edge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Activate Shields</strong>: Place a number of shield
                        tokens on each Ship card equal to that card's
                        shield value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prepare Other Components</strong>: Shuffle the
                        Damage deck and place it facedown outside the
                        play area within reach of both players along with
                        the maneuver templates, dice, range ruler, and
                        the remaining tokens.

                <h3>Shields</h3>
                <p>
                    Shields allow a ship to suffer damage without the risk of
                    being dealt faceup Damage cards. The blue number on a
                    Ship card is the ship's shield value, indicating how many
                    shield tokens to place on the Ship card during setup.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship cannot have more shield tokens than its
                        shield value. If a ship has a number of shield tokens
                        equal to its shield value, it cannot recover shields.

                <h3>Ship</h3>
                <p>
                    A ship is composed of a plastic figure, pegs, a base,
                    and a ship token, plus ID tokens if necessary.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship's plastic figure must match the ship's type
                        as indicated on the Ship card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A ship must use the maneuver dial that matches
                        the ship's type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some plastic figures extend beyond the plastic
                        base. For this reason, the plastic figure does
                        not affect any game mechanics. It may overlap
                        obstacles and hang over the edge of the play
                        area without issue. If a ship's plastic figure would
                        touch another figure or obstruct its movement,
                        the players should add or remove one peg from
                        the base to prevent this overlap.
                    </li>

                <h3>Simultaneous Attack Rule</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Combat phase, all ships with a pilot skill
                    value equal to the active ship have the opportunity
                    to attack before being destroyed. If a ship would be
                    destroyed and it has the same pilot skill value as the
                    active ship but has not had an opportunity to attack
                    yet, it is not destroyed. Instead, it retains its Damage
                    cards and continues to function as normal, suffering
                    any effects on its Damage cards. After it has had its
                    opportunity to attack, it is destroyed and removed
                    from the play area.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Even if the ship did not have a valid target for
                        an attack, it is removed after its opportunity to
                        attack passes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the Simultaneous Attack Rule keeps a ship
                        in the play area, that ship's abilities and Damage
                        cards remain active.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After a ship has resolved its opportunity to
                        attack, before it is destroyed, it can resolve any
                        abilities that trigger after performing an attack.

                    A small ship uses a plastic base that is about
                    1-9/16" (4 cm) long. Small ships do not follow any
                    special rules, though their size may be referred to by

                        paired with a speed value of "0" to indicate that
                        the ship does not move from its current position.

                    When a ship spends a token or other component,
                    that component is removed from the ship and
                    returned to the supply. A ship cannot spend a

                    effect specifies otherwise.

                <p>
                    Each player builds a squad by choosing ships and
                    upgrades whose total squad point cost does not
                    exceed the total agreed upon by the players during
                    the "Gather Forces" step of setup. The squad point
                    cost of each ship and upgrade is printed in the lowerright
                    corner of each card. The recommended squad
                    point total for a standard dogfight is 100 points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A player can build a squad using any available ships

                <p>
                    A ship is stressed while it has a stress token
                    assigned to it. A stressed ship cannot execute red
                    maneuvers or perform actions, even free actions. A
                    ship receives one stress token when it executes a

                        A ship can have more than one stress token assigned to it.

                        When a ship executes a green maneuver, it
                        removes one stress token from itself even if
                        it moves through or overlaps an obstacle or
                        another ship.

                        A stressed ship cannot execute red maneuvers
                        or perform actions. If a stressed ship reveals a
                        red maneuver, the opposing player chooses any
                        non-red maneuver on that ship's dial for that ship
                        to execute.

                    type of ship. A ship cannot equip more than one title.

                <h3>Touching</h3>
                <p>
                    Two ships are touching if one ship overlapped the
                    other ship while executing a maneuver and their
                    bases are touching as a result. A ship cannot attack
                    another ship that it is touching.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If two ships are touching, they remain touching
                        until one of the ships moves (executes a
                        maneuver, decloaks, or performs an action) in a
                        way that results in their bases no longer being in
                        physical contact.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Sometimes a round will end with two ships
                                touching each other, parallel, and facing the
                                same direction. After both ships execute
                                a maneuver, boost, or barrel roll, they are
                                not touching (even if their bases are still in
                                physical contact) unless they overlapped.
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        A ship can be touching two or more ships if it
                        overlaps those ships and its base remains in
                        contact with them after pulling back along the
                        maneuver template.

                <h3>Tracing Tokens</h3>
                <p>
                    Tracking tokens are used to track the number of
                    rounds played during a game. When tracking rounds,
                    the players place one tracking token next to the play
                    area during setup and at the end of each round.
                    The number of tracking tokens next to the play area
                    indicates the current round number.

                    <li>
                        Tracking tokens are not used unless the players
                        are using the "Round Limit" optional rule or
                        playing a mission that requires the number of

                <p>
                    Some ships use a turret as their primary weapon.
                    Each of these ships has a unique primary weapon
                    icon, and each ship token shows a circular red arrow
                    around the token's center as a reminder. When
                    attacking with a turret primary weapon, a ship may
                    target an enemy ship inside or outside its firing arc.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A ship with a turret primary weapon still has a
                        printed firing arc that is not 360&deg;.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When attacking with a secondary weapon, the
                        ship must still target an enemy ship inside its
                        firing arc (unless specified otherwise on its
                        Upgrade card).

                <p>
                    Some Ship cards and Upgrade cards have unique
                    names, which are identified by the bullet (<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-unique"></i>) to the
                    left of the name. A player cannot field two or more
                    cards that share the same unique name, even if
                    those cards are of different types.

                <h3>Upgrade Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    When building a squad, a player can field upgrades
                    for his ships by paying their squad point cost, which
                    is listed in the lower-right corner of each Upgrade
                    card. The upgrade bar along the bottom of a Ship
                    card displays icons that represent which upgrades
                    that ship can equip. For each icon shown in the
                    upgrade bar, the ship can equip one Upgrade card
                    with the matching icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Upgrade cards have one or more of the
                    following traits in their card text:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modification</strong>: These upgrades can be
                        equipped to any ship, but a ship is limited to one
                        modification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Title</strong>: These upgrades can be equipped to any
                        ship, but a ship is limited to one title.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Limited</strong>: A ship cannot equip more than one
                        copy of the same card with this trait.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rebel/Imperial/Scum only</strong>: This
                        upgrade can only be equipped to a ship of the
                        specified faction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Small/Large/Huge ship only</strong>: This
                        upgrade can only be equipped to a ship of the
                        specified size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ship-type only</strong>: This upgrade can only be
                        equipped to a ship of the specified type. If the
                        ship's type includes the entirety of the restricted
                        type, it can equip that upgrade. For example,
                        a TIE/fo fighter can equip an Upgrade card
                        restricted to "TIE Fighter only."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When an Upgrade card is discarded, it is flipped
                        facedown. The card is out of play for all purposes
                        except when determining the total squad point
                        cost of the ship to which it was equipped. If an
                        Upgrade card is flipped faceup by a game effect,
                        it returns to play equipped to the same ship.

                <p>
                    Each secondary weapon has a weapon range
                    indicated on its Upgrade card below the red attack
                    value. A ship cannot attack with a secondary weapon
                    unless the target is at the specified weapon range
                    (e.g. if the weapon range is Range 2-3, the weapon
                    cannot be used at Range 1).

                <h3>Winning The Game</h3>
                <p>
                    The game ends at the end of a round if all of a
                    player's ships are destroyed. The player with no ships
                    remaining loses, and the player with at least one ship
                    remaining wins. If both players' last remaining ships
                    are destroyed in the same round, the game ends in
                    a draw.

                        If playing a mission, when one player achieves his
                        objective for that mission, the game immediately
                        ends and that player wins.

                <h2>Optional Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    Before beginning a game, the players may agree to
                    use one or more of the following optional rules.
                </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Team Play</h3>
                <p>
                    Although a game of X-Wing always consists of two
                    sides, it is possible to play the game with more than
                    two players. To play with more than two players, the
                    players divide themselves as equally as possible into
                    two teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is recommended that players use the squadbuilding
                    rules when playing with teams. Each team
                    receives the same number of squad points regardless
                    of the number of players on that team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each player takes ownership over a number of ships
                    on his team, as agreed on by the other players on his
                    team. Each player plans maneuvers for his own ships
                    and makes all decisions for his actions and attacks.
                    Abilities that affect ships belonging to the same team
                    (for example, the ability of "Epsilon Leader") affect all
                    ships on that team, regardless of who the owner is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players win (and lose) together as a team. It is
                    possible for all of one player's ships to be destroyed,
                    but for his team to win if his teammate manages to
                    destroy all of the opposing team's ships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players on the same team may strategize against
                    their opponents. Players are free to discuss any
                    information with teammates (and opponents), but
                    all discussion must take place in public (i.e., their
                    opponents must be able to hear all discussion).
                    Teammates may show each other the maneuvers
                    chosen on their dials.

                <h3>Round Limit and Time Limit</h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of playing a game until all of one player's
                    ships are destroyed, the players can use a round
                    limit or time limit to restrict the length of a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use a round limit, the players agree on a number of
                    rounds to play before setup. After the players play the
                    number of rounds they agreed upon, the game ends.
                    Similarly, the players can use a time limit instead
                    by agreeing on an amount of time to play. When the
                    predetermined length of time has elapsed, the players
                    finish the current round and the game ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine the winner of a round-limit or time-limit
                    game, each player determines his score by summing
                    the total squad point value of each enemy ship that
                    was destroyed, including the cost of all Upgrade cards
                    attached to those ships (even if they are discarded).
                    The player with the highest score wins the game! If
                    their scores are tied, the game ends in a draw.
