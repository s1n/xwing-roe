                    phase, each ship may spend a cloak token to decloak, starting with the ship with the lowest pilot skill (using initiative to break
                    ties). When a ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                <p>
                    Decloaking is not an action or a maneuver, and a ship can decloak while it has a stress token.

                <p>
                    A ship cannot decloak if it would overlap another ship or an obstacle token, or if the maneuver template would overlap an obstacle
                    token.

                    The first time a small ship receives a tractor beam token each round, the opposing player may choose one of the following effects:

                        The opposing player selects the direction of the barrel roll and the final position of the ship.

                    <li>
                        Perform a boost using the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 1] maneuver template.

                <h2>Section 2: Rule Clarifications</h2>
                <p>
                    This section explains various rules interactions and makes other clarifications.

                <h3>Altered Pilot Skill</h3>
                <p>
                    Some abilities alter the pilot skill value of a ship. If several game effects alter the pilot skill of a ship, only the most
                    recent effect is applied. For example, if a Green Squadron Pilot equips Veteran Instincts, it increases its pilot skill from 3 to
                    5. However, if it later receives the "Damaged Cockpit" Damage card faceup, its pilot skill is reduced from 5 to 0 (rather than 2).
                    Next round, however, Wedge Antilles can use Swarm Tactics to raise its pilot skill to 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, during the Combat phase, if the pilot skill of a ship that has not activated this phase changes to be higher than
                    the current active ship, that ship does not become the active ship this phase. For example, if Tel Trevura has the "Damaged
                    Cockpit" Damage card and is destroyed (for the first time) by a ship at pilot skill 5, he discards his damage cards. Therefore,
                    his pilot skill changes to 7 and he cannot become the active ship this phase.

                <h3>Assigning a Token to Your Ship</h3>
                <p>
                    When an ability instructs you to assign a token to your ship, this is different than performing a free action that provides the
                    same token. For example, Kyle Katarn's (pilot) ability allows you to "assign 1 of your focus tokens to another friendly ship at
                    Range 1-3." A ship that has a focus or evade token assigned to it can still perform that action during the round.

            <section>
                <h3>"At" vs. "Within"</h3>
                <p>
                    "At" means the closest part of the target's base touches that range section. For example, when attacking a ship whose base touches
                    both Range 2 and Range 3, that ship is at Range 2. "Within" means wholly within. For example, normal tournament deployment
                    is "within Range 1 of the table edge."

                <h3>Acquiring a Target Lock</h3>
                <p>
                    When acquiring a target lock, a player must first declare the intended target. Then, he measures range to the declared target to
                    see if the target is within legal range. If the target is in range, the ship performing the action must acquire a target lock on
                    the target. If the target is not in range, the player may declare a different target, or he may declare a different action.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Assigning Incorrect Ship Dials</h3>
                <p>
                    If a player assigns the wrong ship dial to his ship (for example, assigning a B-wing dial to an X-wing), when he reveals the dial
                    he must inform his opponent of the error. If the revealed maneuver is a legal maneuver for that ship (for example, the revealed
                    B-wing dial shows a red [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 4] maneuver, a maneuver whose
                    bearing and speed also appears on the X-wing ship dial), it is executed with the proper difficulty of the maneuver (in this
                    example, white). If the revealed maneuver is not a legal maneuver for that ship (for example, the B-wing dial shows a red
                    [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-leftturn"></i> 1] maneuver, a maneuver that does <strong>not</strong>
                    appear on the X-wing ship dial), the player's opponent chooses which legal maneuver from that ship's actual dial that ship will
                    perform.

                <h3>Bumping Ships</h3>
                <p>
                    If a player knocks a ship over, he must endeavor to replace it exactly as he found it. If there is any disagreement about its
                    placement, the player's opponent has final say over its position, though he must attempt to match the ship's original position.

            <section>
                <h3>Illegal Dial</h3>
                <p>
                    If a player reveals a dial that is stuck between two different maneuvers in such a way that it is impossible to determine which
                    maneuver was selected, the player's opponent chooses which of those two maneuvers that ship will perform.

                <h3>Increasing and Reducing Values</h3>
                <p>
                    When multiple card effects or abilities increase or reduce a value, such as agility, ignore any "to a minimum of 0" restrictions
                    until the calculation is complete. For example, if a ship with a printed agility value of "0" and the "Structural Damage" Damage
                    card (reducing its agility by 1 to a minimum of 0) uses Countermeasures, (increasing its agility by 1) its agility is "0."

                <h3>Inside Firing Arc at Range X</h3>
                <p>
                    Some card abilities use the expression "inside firing arc at Range X" or "inside firing arc beyond Range X." This compound phrase
                    defines a specific situation where the closest point to closest point distance between two ships, when measured inside firing arc,
                    is at a specific range band. See the diagram below.

                        <h4>Inside Firing Arc at Range X Example</h4>
                        <p>
                            A K-wing equipped with the Tactician Upgrade card is attacking with its turret primary weapon, and has a choice of three
                            possible targets. If it attacks the TIE fighter, Tactician would trigger, since the TIE fighter is inside arc at Range 2.
                            If it attacks the Firespray-31, it would roll 1 additional attack die, because the closest point to closest point
                            measurement between the K-wing and the Firespray-31 is Range 1, and trigger Tactician, because the Firespray-31 is inside
                            arc at Range 2. If the K-wing attacks the TIE Adv. Prototype (which is equipped with Autothrusters), the closest point to
                            closest point measurement between the K-wing and the TIE Adv. Prototype is Range 2, but the TIE Adv. Prototype is inside
                            arc at Range 3. Therefore, the TIE Adv. Prototype will not roll an additional defense die and Tactician will not trigger,
                            but Autothrusters will trigger.

                <h3>Measuring Range</h3>
                <p>
                    Players may only measure range and/or use the range ruler to determine whether a ship is inside or outside of a firing arc at the
                    following times:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When a ship becomes the active ship during the combat phase, the active player can measure range from the active ship to any
                        enemy ships before declaring one as its target.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a player declares a ship's ability that requires another ship (or ships) to be at a certain range, the player trying to
                        resolve the ability can measure range from their ship to any valid ships before resolving the ability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After declaring the intended target of a target lock action, the active player may measure range to the intended target, and
                        only to the intended target.
                    </li>

                <h3>Missed Opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, players forget to resolve important effects during the course of a game. At formal and premier events, once an
                    opportunity is missed and play has proceeded past that timing window, the opportunity is lost:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a player forgets to perform an action with a ship and play has proceeded to the next ship (a dial has been revealed, a
                        maneuver has been executed, etc.), that ship loses its chance to perform an action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player forgets to place a maneuver dial next to a ship, but tells his opponent he is ready to begin the round, once play
                        has proceeded to the first ship (a dial has been revealed, a maneuver has been executed, etc.), he may no longer place a dial.
                        Instead, when that ship activates, the player's opponent chooses the maneuver that ship will perform. No actions may be taken
                        before this maneuver, but play proceeds normally after the maneuver has been executed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player forgets to declare a game effect during a specific timing window (such as declaring the target of Swarm Tactics at
                        the start of the Combat phase), he may not execute that game effect at a later time.

                            If derived information is dependent on a player's previous decision or action, he or she must answer truthfully when asked
                            about that decision or action. For example, Steph chooses to use Corran Horn's ability during the End phase. During the
                            following Planning phase, Bryan forgets whether Corran Horn used his ability or not and asks Steph. Steph must answer
                            honestly that Corran Horn did use his ability the previous turn.

                            Hidden information is any information about the game, game state, or ships unavailable to one or more players. This

                            the information. However, if a player that has access to hidden information about the game or a card and chooses to

                <h3>Overlapping In-line Ships</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a round will end with two ships touching each other, parallel, and facing the same direction. After both ships execute a
                    maneuver of the same speed or perform the same boost or barrel roll action, they are not touching even if their bases are still in
                    physical contact (unless they overlapped).

                <h3>Parallel Ships and Attacking</h3>
                <p>
                    If an attacking ship is perfectly parallel to the defender such that there are multiple "closest points" on the defender's base or
                    the closest point cannot be accurately determined, the attacker chooses where to draw the closest point to closest point line.

                <p>
                    When performing a barrel roll, a player must first declare from which side of the ship's base the action will be performed. Then,
                    he measures to see if the ship is able to perform a barrel roll action to any legal area on the declared side, moving the template
                    as necessary. If the ship can perform the barrel roll action on the declared side, it must do so. If the ship cannot perform the
                    barrel roll action, the player may declare a barrel roll in the other direction, or he may declare a different action.

                <p>
                    When performing a boost, a player must declare which maneuver template and direction he will use. Then, he measures to see if the
                    ship is able to perform a boost action with the declared template in the desired direction. If the ship can perform the boost
                    action, it must do so. If the ship cannot perform the boost action, the player may declare a different maneuver template or
                    direction to use, or he may declare a different action.

                <h3>Resolving Large Ship Collisions</h3>
                <p>
                    It can sometimes be difficult to precisely resolve collisions. This is especially true for a large ship attempting to perform a
                    turn maneuver that overlaps another ship. To accurately resolve these collisions, set the turn template in place to mark the
                    position of the large ship, remove the ship from the play area temporarily, and place a
                    [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i>] template on each end of the turn template. Then, resolve
                    the collision as normal, moving the ship backward along the template until it no longer overlaps another ship. Use the
                    [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i>] templates as a visual reference while moving the ship,
                    adjusting the ship so that the front and rear guides remain centered over the templates.

                    When a player reveals a red maneuver for a stressed ship, he has an opportunity to resolve card effects that change the maneuver's
                    difficulty or change the maneuver to a different one (Adrenaline Rush, Navigator, etc.). After resolving these effects, if the
                    ship would still be executing a red maneuver, <span class="updates">the owner moves the ship as if it were assigned a white

                <p>
                    When a player is required to roll attack or defense dice, if he rolls too many dice, he must pick up all of his dice and reroll
                    them. If he rolls too few dice, he must leave the roll intact and roll the required number of additional dice, adding the new
                    results to the original roll.

                <p>
                    When a player is instructed to reroll a number of dice, he must choose all of the dice that he will reroll before rerolling any.

                <p>
                    If a rolled die is cocked (not level), it must be rerolled.

                <h3>Spending Tokens</h3>
                <p>
                    When attacking, players may spend target locks and choose to reroll 0 attack dice. Additionally, players may spend a focus token
                    even if they do not roll any <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results. When defending, players
                    may spend focus tokens even if they do not roll any <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> results
                    and may spend evade tokens to add evade results in excess of the number of hit and critical hit results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focus, evade, and target lock tokens cannot be spent for their normal effect more than once during the "Modify Attack Dice" and
                    "Modify Defense Dice" steps. For example, a ship cannot spend 2 evade tokens to add 2 evade results. However, a ship can spend
                    more than 1 of each token on different effects, such as spending 1 focus token as the cost for Calculation and another focus token
                    focus token for its inherent effect.

                    A ship can end its maneuver touching multiple ships. If a ship overlaps two ships, and its own base ends its maneuver touching
                    both ships it has overlapped after moving backwards along the template, the overlapping ship is considered to be touching both
                    overlapped ships, and both overlapped ships are touching it.

                            A ship equipped with Boba Fett can use his ability if the defender was dealt a faceup Damage card from any source during
                            that ship's attack. Boba Fett cannot be used during an attack if the ship with Boba Fett equipped is not the ship

                            See Experimental Interface. Free actions, such as a free action granted from Squad Leader, can trigger Push the Limit.
                            This can result in an action interrupting another effect, causing that effect to finish resolving later. For example, if a
                            ship performs a free barrel roll action granted by Expert Handling, it could use that action as a trigger for Push the
                            Limit. After Push the Limit resolves, Expert Handling finishes resolving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, the free action granted from Push the Limit can itself trigger other abilities that occur after performing
                            an action. Those abilities resolve before the ship receives the stress token from Push the Limit. For example, a ship also
                            equipped with TIE/v1 can boost, use Push the Limit to target lock, then perform the free evade from TIE/v1 before
                            receiving the stress from Push the Limit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a player uses Push the Limit to attempt an action he is unable to perform (such as attempting to Target Lock a ship
                            that is out of range), he may perform a different action or decide not to use Push the Limit at all.

                        If a player has multiple effects that resolve at the same time, can he resolve them in any order?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes.

                        If both players have effects that resolve at the same time (or from the same trigger), which player resolves their abilities
                        first?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The player with initiative resolves all abilities he would like to resolve, then the other player resolves all abilities he
                        would like to resolve.

                    <dd class="updates">
                        No. Rolling dice and rerolling dice are different game effects.

                        I noticed the Scum &amp; Villainy Firespray-31 Ship cards are missing the auxilliary firing arc symbol. Is this a mistake?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes, this is a misprint. Scum &amp; Villiany Firespray-31s have an auxilliary firing arc; it is printed on their ship tokens,
                        just like Imperial Firespray-31s.

                        Does the special firing arc introduced with the VCX-100 change the range of its equipped torpedoes?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. The range values printed on the torpedoes are still used.

                        Do firing arcs that are not primary firing arcs (such as an auxiliary, <span class="changes">mobile</span>, or special firing
                        arc) count as firing arcs for card abilities such as "Backstabber" or Outmaneuver?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>

                    <dt>
                        If a ship has a turret primary weapon (or is equipped with a
                        <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-turret"></i> secondary weapon), is the ship considered to have a

                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. Turret primary and secondary weapons allow a ship to ignore its printed firing arcs. A ship's firing arcs are always the
                        printed, shaded arcs on its ship token.

                        Can a ship decloak or perform a boost or barrel roll that would cause it to go outside the play area (and thus flee the
                        battlefield)?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. A ship cannot decloak or perform a boost or barrel roll if this would cause its base to go outside the play area. This
                        includes a boost or barrel roll caused from receiving a tractor beam token.

                    <dt>
                        If a ship is required to skip its “Perform Action” step (for example, if its final position overlapped another ship), is it
                        still allowed to perform free actions outside of the “Perform Action” step?
                    </dt>

                        Yes.

                    <dt>
                        Can a ship that is overlapping an asteroid perform free actions?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes.

                    <dt>
                        Are the movement guides on bomb tokens considered when measuring range or when a ship overlaps them?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        When a player wishes to perform a boost action, can he measure to see if his ship can perform a boost before committing to
                        this action (similar to a barrel roll)?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. In formal and premier events, the player must declare the direction before attempting the maneuver (see "Performing a
                        Barrel Roll" on page 5).
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If a ship already has a target lock on an enemy ship, can the locking ship acquire a target lock again on the same enemy ship
                        in order to trigger a game effect (such as "Dutch" Vander)?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes.

                    <dt>
                        When an ability instructs you to acquire a target lock, does the locked ship need to be at Range 1–3?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes, unless the ability explicitly states otherwise or another ability modifies the range at which the ship can acquire target
                        locks.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Can a bomb token be dropped outside the play area?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. The portion of the bomb token that is outside the play area is ignored.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Can a ship perform the same Upgrade card action or Damage card action more than once per round?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. Having more than one copy of the same card that requires an action to trigger its ability does not allow you to perform
                        that action more than once per round.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If I have a ship equipped with multiple bombs, can I drop more than one in the same round?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. Each ship is limited to a single bomb drop each round.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If a ship has more than one copy of the same card that does not require an action to trigger its ability, can it trigger all
                        of those card abilities?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. For example, when a ship equipped with two Mercenary Copilots is attacking, it can change two results to two results.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Can a ship have more than one focus, evade, or stress token assigned to it?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. A ship cannot perform focus or evade actions more than once during a round, but a game effect (such as Garven Dreis'
                        pilot ability) may assign additional tokens to a ship.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Can a ship decloak if it is ionized?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. Because decloaking occurs at the start of the Activation phase, a ship may decloak regardless of whether a dial is
                        assigned.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Does the SLAM action count as revealing your dial for the sake of card abilities (such as dropping a bomb)?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No, it does not count as revealing your dial.

                        If a ship suffers more damage or critical damage than is needed to destroy it, are the excess Damage cards still assigned to
                        that ship?

                    <dd>
                        Yes. This means that a ship in the play area due to the Simultaneous Attack Rule may be affected by additional faceup Damage
                        cards.

                    <dd>
                        No. After spending a target lock token to attack with a secondary weapon, he no longer has that target lock to spend for
                        rerolling.

                        If there are multiple abilities that were identified during step 9 of the timing chart (such as IG-88B and Dengar) what
                        happens to an ability that was not chosen?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        When step 9 is reached again, the player with initiative can resolve one of his abilities that were not resolved during a
                        previous step 9. If that player does not resolve an ability, then the other player can choose to resolve 1. For example,
                        IG-88B attacks Dengar with an Ion Cannon and misses. Step 9 is reached, and the player controlling Dengar has initiative. He
                        chooses to activate Dengar's ability first and perform an attack. When step 9 is reached again, the player with initiative has
                        no abilities left to resolve and therefore the player controlling IG-88B resolves IG-88B's ability and performs another attack
                        against Dengar.

                    <dd>
                        The ability occurs after the damage cards are dealt. Typically, this is during the "Deal Damage" step of combat. Although the
                        ship is destroyed, effects from the ship's pilot ability, Upgrade cards, Damage cards, etc. are still active until it is
                        removed at the end of the attack.

                    <dt>
                        When the Simultaneous Attack Rule keeps a ship in play until it performs its attack, are all effects pertaining to that ship

                    <dd>
                        Yes. Effects from the ship’s pilot ability, Upgrade cards, Damage cards, etc. are still active and may affect the game until
                        it performs an attack, at which point it is immediately removed.

                    <dd>
                        Yes. If a ship’s base extends beyond two edges of the play area at the same time, the ship is destroyed instead of fleeing

                        After a ship executes a maneuver, if its maneuver template is outside the play area but the ship’s base is not outside the
                        play area, has that ship fled the battlefield?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If two or more game effects that change the difficulty of a maneuver conflict, which effect takes priority?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        An effect that increases the difficulty of a maneuver takes priority over an effect that decreases the difficulty. For
                        example, if a ship equipped with R2 Astromech is dealt the Damaged Engine Damage card, all of the ship’s turn maneuvers are
                        treated as red maneuvers, including the 1-speed and 2-speed turn maneuvers.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        A ship executes a maneuver in which its template or final position overlaps an obstacle or mine token. Due to avoiding
                        collisions with other ships, it ends up stopping before reaching the obstacle or mine token. Does it still suffer the effects
                        of moving through or overlapping that obstacle or mine token?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Can overlapping other ships cause the active ship to flee the battlefield?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. If any part of the ship’s base in its final position (after moving backward) is outside the play area, then the ship has
                        fled the battlefield.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        When a ship executes a maneuver, is the entire width of the ship considered to be moving along the maneuver template and
                        possibly hitting obstacles?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. Only the maneuver template itself and the final position of the ship are considered when determining if a ship hit an
                        obstacle.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        After a ship moves through or overlaps more than one obstacle, does the ship suffer the effect of each obstacle?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. The ship suffers the effects of each obstacle, starting with the obstacle closest to its starting position and proceeding
                        outward.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If a ship executes a green maneuver and overlaps a ship or obstacle, is one stress token still removed from it?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If a ship is already overlapping an obstacle, does it suffer the effects of the obstacle when it executes its next maneuver?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Possibly. When it executes its next maneuver, if the maneuver template or the ship’s final position overlaps the obstacle, the
                        ship suffers the effects of the obstacle. Otherwise, the ship doesn’t suffer any of the obstacle’s effects because its
                        original position is ignored.

                <h3>Range Measurement</h3>
                <dl class="faq">
                    <dt>
                        Some card abilities, such as "Howlrunner," Biggs Darklighter, and Squad Leader depend on a certain range requirement in order
                        to take effect. From where is this range requirement measured?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        It is measured from the ship that has this ability. For example, Howlrunner’s ability affects friendly ships at Range 1 from
                        Howlrunner’s ship.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        When measuring with the range ruler, does the entire width of the ruler matter?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. Players should use a <strong>single edge</strong> of the range ruler when measuring. Also, the width of the ruler does not
                        matter when determining if an obstacle obstructs an attack.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        If a ship attacks an enemy ship with a turret weapon and the defender is also inside its firing arc, can the attacker choose
                        to measure range using the rules for its firing arc instead of the rules for a turret weapon?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. When attacking with a weapon that can target ships outside of firing arc, range is measured from the closest point to the
                        closest point.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Some game abilities, such as Jan Ors and Opportunist, allow ships to roll an extra attack die when attacking. When do these
                        abilities happen?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Any additional dice must be added during the "Roll Attack Dice" step of the Combat phase, before any rolls are made.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Is a ship considered to be at Range 1 of itself?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes.
