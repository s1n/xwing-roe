                <p>
                    This card should read:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "At the start of the Activation phase, after players have resolved all other
                    abilities that trigger at the start of the Activation phase, each ship may spend
                    a cloak token to decloak, starting with the ship with the lowest pilot skill
                    (using initiative to break ties). When a ship decloaks, it must choose one of the
                    following effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Perform a barrel roll using the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 2] maneuver template.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Perform a boost using the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 2] maneuver template.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Decloaking is not an action or a maneuver, and a ship can decloak while it has
                    a stress token.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A ship cannot decloak if it would overlap another ship or an obstacle token, or if
                    the maneuver template would overlap an obstacle token.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all decloaking has been resolved, the Activation phase continues as
                    normal."

                <p>

                    "A ship with at least one tractor beam token assigned to it follows special

                <p>
                    The first time a small ship receives a tractor beam token each round, the
                    opposing player may choose one of the following effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Perform a barrel roll using the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 1] maneuver template. The opposing
                        player selects the direction of the barrel roll and the final position of the
                        ship.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Perform a boost using the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 1] maneuver template.

                    This section explains various rules interactions and makes other clarifications.

                <h3>Altered Pilot Skill</h3>
                <p>
                    Some abilities alter the pilot skill value of a ship. If several game effects alter
                    the pilot skill of a ship, only the most recent effect is applied. For example,
                    if a Green Squadron Pilot equips Veteran Instincts, it increases its pilot skill
                    from 3 to 5. However, if it later receives the "Damaged Cockpit" Damage
                    card faceup, its pilot skill is reduced from 5 to 0 (rather than 2). Next round,
                    however, Wedge Antilles can use Swarm Tactics to raise its pilot skill to 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, during the Combat phase, if the pilot skill of a ship that has not
                    activated this phase changes to be higher than the current active ship, that
                    ship does not become the active ship this phase. For example, if Tel Trevura
                    has the "Damaged Cockpit" Damage card and is destroyed (for the first time)
                    by a ship at pilot skill 5, he discards his damage cards. Therefore, his pilot
                    skill changes to 7 and he cannot become the active ship this phase.

                <h3>Assigning a Token to Your Ship</h3>
                <p>
                    When an ability instructs you to assign a token to your ship, this is different
                    than performing a free action that provides the same token. For example, Kyle
                    Katarn's (pilot) ability allows you to "assign 1 of your focus tokens to another
                    friendly ship at Range 1-3." A ship that has a focus or evade token assigned
                    to it can still perform that action during the round.

                <h3>"At" vs. "Within"</h3>
                <p>
                    "At" means the closest part of the target's base touches that range section.
                    For example, when attacking a ship whose base touches both Range 2 and
                    Range 3, that ship is at Range 2. "Within" means wholly within. For example,
                    normal tournament deployment is "within Range 1 of the table edge."

                <h3>Acquiring a Target Lock</h3>
                <p>
                    When acquiring a target lock, a player must first declare the intended target.
                    Then, he measures range to the declared target to see if the target is within
                    legal range. If the target is in range, the ship performing the action must
                    acquire a target lock on the target. If the target is not in range, the player
                    may declare a different target, or he may declare a different action.
                </p>

                <h3>Assigning Incorrect Ship Dials</h3>
                <p>
                    If a player assigns the wrong ship dial to his ship (for example, assigning
                    a B-wing dial to an X-wing), when he reveals the dial he must inform his
                    opponent of the error. If the revealed maneuver is a legal maneuver for that
                    ship (for example, the revealed B-wing dial shows a red [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i> 4] maneuver, a
                    maneuver whose bearing and speed also appears on the X-wing ship dial), it is
                    executed with the proper difficulty of the maneuver (in this example, white). If
                    the revealed maneuver is not a legal maneuver for that ship (for example, the
                    B-wing dial shows a red [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-leftturn"></i> 1] maneuver, a maneuver that does <strong>not</strong> appear
                    on the X-wing ship dial), the player's opponent chooses which legal maneuver
                    from that ship's actual dial that ship will perform.

                <h3>Bumping Ships</h3>
                <p>
                    If a player knocks a ship over, he must endeavor to replace it exactly as
                    he found it. If there is any disagreement about its placement, the player's
                    opponent has final say over its position, though he must attempt to match the
                    ship's original position.

                <h3>Illegal Dial</h3>
                <p>
                    If a player reveals a dial that is stuck between two different maneuvers in
                    such a way that it is impossible to determine which maneuver was selected,
                    the player's opponent chooses which of those two maneuvers that ship will
                    perform.

                <h3>Increasing and Reducing Values</h3>
                <p>
                    When multiple card effects or abilities increase or reduce a value, such as
                    agility, ignore any "to a minimum of 0" restrictions until the calculation is
                    complete. For example, if a ship with a printed agility value of "0" and the
                    "Structural Damage" Damage card (reducing its agility by 1 to a minimum
                    of 0) uses Countermeasures, (increasing its agility by 1) its agility is "0."

                <h3>Inside Firing Arc at Range X</h3>
                <p>
                    Some card abilities use the expression "inside firing arc at Range X" or "inside
                    firing arc beyond Range X." This compound phrase defines a specific situation
                    where the closest point to closest point distance between two ships, when
                    measured inside firing arc, is at a specific range band. See the diagram
                    below.

                        <h4>Inside Firing Arc at Range X Example</h4>
                        <p>
                            A K-wing equipped with the Tactician Upgrade card is attacking with its
                            turret primary weapon, and has a choice of three possible targets. If it
                            attacks the TIE fighter, Tactician would trigger, since the TIE fighter is
                            inside arc at Range 2. If it attacks the Firespray-31, it would roll
                            1 additional attack die, because the closest point to closest point
                            measurement between the K-wing and the Firespray-31 is Range 1,
                            and trigger Tactician, because the Firespray-31 is inside arc at Range
                            2. If the K-wing attacks the TIE Adv. Prototype (which is equipped with
                            Autothrusters), the closest point to closest point measurement between
                            the K-wing and the TIE Adv. Prototype is Range 2, but the TIE Adv.
                            Prototype is inside arc at Range 3. Therefore, the TIE Adv. Prototype
                            will not roll an additional defense die and Tactician will not trigger, but
                            Autothrusters will trigger.

                <h3>Measuring Range</h3>
                <p>
                    Players may only measure range and/or use the range ruler to determine
                    whether a ship is inside or outside of a firing arc at the following times:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When a ship becomes the active ship during the combat phase, the active
                        player can measure range from the active ship to any enemy ships before
                        declaring one as its target.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a player declares a ship's ability that requires another ship (or ships)
                        to be at a certain range, the player trying to resolve the ability can measure
                        range from their ship to any valid ships before resolving the ability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After declaring the intended target of a target lock action, the active player
                        may measure range to the intended target, and only to the intended target.

                <h3>Missed Opportunities</h3>

                    Occasionally, players forget to resolve important effects during the course of
                    a game. At formal and premier events, once an opportunity is missed and play
                    has proceeded past that timing window, the opportunity is lost:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a player forgets to perform an action with a ship and play has proceeded
                        to the next ship (a dial has been revealed, a maneuver has been executed,
                        etc.), that ship loses its chance to perform an action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player forgets to place a maneuver dial next to a ship, but tells his
                        opponent he is ready to begin the round, once play has proceeded to
                        the first ship (a dial has been revealed, a maneuver has been executed,
                        etc.), he may no longer place a dial. Instead, when that ship activates, the
                        player's opponent chooses the maneuver that ship will perform. No actions
                        may be taken before this maneuver, but play proceeds normally after the
                        maneuver has been executed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player forgets to declare a game effect during a specific timing
                        window (such as declaring the target of Swarm Tactics at the start of the
                        Combat phase), he may not execute that game effect at a later time.

                            information from an opponent or omit specific details. A player must allow

                            effects or through the process of deduction using open information. This
                            includes a player's current score, how many Direct Hit damage cards
                            might remain in a damage deck, which ship a dial belongs to, etc.

                            the End phase. During the following Planning phase, Bryan forgets whether
                            Corran Horn used his ability or not and asks Steph. Steph must answer
                            honestly that Corran Horn did use his ability the previous turn.

                <h3>Overlapping In-line Ships</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a round will end with two ships touching each other, parallel, and
                    facing the same direction. After both ships execute a maneuver of the same
                    speed or perform the same boost or barrel roll action, they are not touching
                    even if their bases are still in physical contact (unless they overlapped).

                <h3>Parallel Ships and Attacking</h3>
                <p>
                    If an attacking ship is perfectly parallel to the defender such that there are
                    multiple "closest points" on the defender's base or the closest point cannot be
                    accurately determined, the attacker chooses where to draw the closest point
                    to closest point line.

                <p>
                    When performing a barrel roll, a player must first declare from which side of
                    the ship's base the action will be performed. Then, he measures to see if the
                    ship is able to perform a barrel roll action to any legal area on the declared
                    side, moving the template as necessary. If the ship can perform the barrel
                    roll action on the declared side, it must do so. If the ship cannot perform the
                    barrel roll action, the player may declare a barrel roll in the other direction, or
                    he may declare a different action.

                <p>
                    When performing a boost, a player must declare which maneuver template and
                    direction he will use. Then, he measures to see if the ship is able to perform a
                    boost action with the declared template in the desired direction. If the ship can
                    perform the boost action, it must do so. If the ship cannot perform the boost
                    action, the player may declare a different maneuver template or direction to
                    use, or he may declare a different action.

                <h3>Resolving Large Ship Collisions</h3>
                <p>
                    It can sometimes be difficult to precisely resolve collisions. This is especially
                    true for a large ship attempting to perform a turn maneuver that overlaps
                    another ship. To accurately resolve these collisions, set the turn template in
                    place to mark the position of the large ship, remove the ship from the play
                    area temporarily, and place a [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i>] template on each end of the turn template.
                    Then, resolve the collision as normal, moving the ship backward along the
                    template until it no longer overlaps another ship. Use the [<i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i>] templates as a
                    visual reference while moving the ship, adjusting the ship so that the front and
                    rear guides remain centered over the templates.

                    When a player reveals a red maneuver for a stressed ship, he has an
                    opportunity to resolve card effects that change the maneuver's difficulty
                    or change the maneuver to a different one (Adrenaline Rush, Navigator,
                    etc.). After resolving these effects, if the ship would still be executing a red
                    maneuver, <span class="updates">the owner moves the ship as if it were assigned a white

                <p>
                    When a player is required to roll attack or defense dice, if he rolls too many
                    dice, he must pick up all of his dice and reroll them. If he rolls too few dice,
                    he must leave the roll intact and roll the required number of additional dice,
                    adding the new results to the original roll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a player is instructed to reroll a number of dice, he must choose all of
                    the dice that he will reroll before rerolling any.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a rolled die is cocked (not level), it must be rerolled.

                <h3>Spending Tokens</h3>
                <p>
                    When attacking, players may spend target locks and choose to reroll 0 attack
                    dice. Additionally, players may spend a focus token even if they do not roll any
                    <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results.
                    When defending, players may spend focus tokens even if they do
                    not roll any <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i>
                    results and may spend evade tokens to add evade results in
                    excess of the number of hit and critical hit results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focus, evade, and target lock tokens cannot be spent for their normal effect
                    more than once during the "Modify Attack Dice" and "Modify Defense Dice"
                    steps. For example, a ship cannot spend 2 evade tokens to add 2 evade
                    results. However, a ship can spend more than 1 of each token on different
                    effects, such as spending 1 focus token as the cost for Calculation and
                    another focus token focus token for its inherent effect.

                    overlapped after moving backwards along the template, the overlapping ship
